# Antibiotic Compatibility and Contraindication Matrix

## Objective

Provide a safety-first framework for antibiotic compatibility decisions in advanced aquatic care workflows where systemic therapy is being considered under veterinary supervision.

## Scope guardrail

This is a high-risk reference, not a hobby dosing guide.

- Use only with veterinary or pharmacy oversight.
- Do not convert human IV tables directly into aquarium dosing.
- When compatibility is uncertain, separate administration paths by default.

## Three compatibility domains to separate

1. **Systemic interaction risk**: one antibiotic changes exposure or toxicity of another.
2. **IV line/contact compatibility**: physical or chemical incompatibility in shared lines.
3. **Intentional combination therapy**: potentially useful synergy that still needs monitoring.

Treat these as different decisions. A pair may be therapeutically useful but still unsafe to co-infuse.

## High-risk patterns (safety flags)

- Aminoglycosides with beta-lactams in the same solution/line segment: inactivation risk
- Vancomycin with beta-lactams in shared-line contact: precipitation risk under many conditions
- Nephrotoxic stacking (for example combinations including vancomycin, aminoglycosides, polymyxins): acute kidney injury risk
- Dual QT-risk antibiotic stacking (for example some macrolide + fluoroquinolone combinations): arrhythmia risk in susceptible patients
- Rifamycin-driven exposure reduction of companion antibiotics: underdosing/clinical failure risk

## Operational IV workflow

If shared-line administration is unavoidable:

1. Verify compatibility for exact concentrations, diluents, and contact time.
2. If exact-condition evidence is missing, do not co-infuse.
3. Prefer separate lumen/line.
4. If separate line is impossible, use sequential dosing with thorough flush between agents.
5. Watch for precipitation, line occlusion, and unexpected instability.

## Monitoring checklist during combination therapy

- Renal function trend (especially with nephrotoxic combinations)
- Drug-level monitoring when applicable (for example vancomycin/aminoglycosides in institutional settings)
- QT and electrolyte risk profile when QT-active combinations are required
- Early clinical response to detect exposure loss in interaction-prone regimens

## Decision rules when uncertain

- Unverified compatibility -> separate paths
- High toxicity overlap -> choose lower-risk alternative if clinically possible
- Reduced-exposure interaction risk -> escalate monitoring or revise regimen
- Multi-drug high-risk patient -> involve specialist support early

## Safety note

This matrix is for controlled clinical contexts and stewardship review. It should not be used as a standalone instruction set for home aquarium antibiotic use.
