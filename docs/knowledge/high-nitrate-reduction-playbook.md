# High Nitrate Reduction Playbook

## Objective

Lower nitrate safely and sustainably in aquarium and pond systems without causing instability.

## Core principle

Use a multi-layer approach:

1. Reduce nitrate input.
2. Increase nitrate export.
3. Improve biological processing.
4. Prevent rebound with monitoring.

## When to trigger this playbook

Start nitrate-reduction protocol when:

- Freshwater nitrate is persistently above your livestock tolerance target.
- Reef nitrate is climbing beyond your selected operating window.
- Nitrate trend is rising over multiple tests despite routine maintenance.

## Priority triage check

Before nitrate correction, rule out acute emergencies:

- Ammonia > 0
- Nitrite > 0
- Oxygen stress/gasping
- Severe temperature instability

If any are present, stabilize those first.

## Practical nitrate targets (operational)

Choose and hold a stable target band based on system type:

- Community freshwater: commonly <20 ppm ideal, <40 ppm often tolerable for many species.
- Sensitive freshwater species: often lower target range.
- Reef: low but non-zero nitrate, with target based on coral type and nutrient strategy.

Do not force nitrate to zero abruptly.

## Nitrate reduction workflow

### Phase 1: Confirm and quantify

1. Re-test nitrate with a second method if values are unexpected.
2. Log current value, recent feeding, stocking changes, and maintenance history.
3. Check source water nitrate contribution.

### Phase 2: Reduce input

1. Cut overfeeding and remove uneaten food quickly.
2. Remove detritus from substrate, filter socks/sponges, and dead zones.
3. Audit bioload relative to filtration and maintenance capacity.

### Phase 3: Increase export

1. Increase scheduled water-change volume/frequency using matched water.
2. Improve mechanical export (pre-filter cleaning cadence).
3. Increase biological export where appropriate:
   - healthy plant growth (freshwater)
   - refugium/macroalgae (marine)
   - tuned denitrification pathways in mature systems

### Phase 4: Stabilize and tune

1. Re-test after each correction cycle.
2. Reduce nitrate in steps, not one aggressive drop.
3. Maintain the least-intensive routine that keeps nitrate in target range.

## Water change sizing formula

If source water nitrate is effectively zero:

- `required_change_fraction = 1 - (target / current)`

Example:

- Current 80 ppm, target 40 ppm -> 50% change.

If source water has nitrate, adjust target calculation accordingly.

## Common failure modes

- Source water already nitrate-loaded.
- Dirty mechanical filtration becoming a nitrate factory.
- Bioload increase without filtration/export increase.
- Carbon dosing/media changes without monitoring.
- Over-correction that destabilizes nutrient balance.

## Monitoring cadence during correction

- During active reduction: test nitrate every 24 to 72 hours.
- After stabilization: weekly trend checks, then routine cadence.

Track trendline, not single readings.
