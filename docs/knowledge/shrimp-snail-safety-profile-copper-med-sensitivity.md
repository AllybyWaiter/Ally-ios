# Shrimp and Snail Safety Profile (Copper and Medication Sensitivity)

## Objective

Provide a safety-first framework for protecting freshwater shrimp and snails during fish treatment events.

## Core principle

Copper and mixed-medication errors can become invertebrate-lethal at concentrations tolerated by fish treatment protocols.

1. Separate fish treatment from invertebrate display whenever possible.
2. Assume copper risk at very low concentrations.
3. Evaluate chemistry-dependent toxicity modifiers.
4. Treat contamination events as urgent.

## Highest-risk exposure classes

- Copper-based medications (ionic or chelated)
- Formalin-containing combinations in mixed invertebrate systems
- Unverified medication combinations that alter copper speciation

## Why risk changes tank-to-tank

Copper toxicity is modified by:

- pH
- Hardness and major ions
- Dissolved organic carbon
- Temperature
- Species and life-stage sensitivity

Do not rely on one universal safe number.

## Safer treatment strategy

1. Move fish to hospital tank for parasite/antimicrobial treatment.
2. Keep shrimp/snail display medication-free.
3. Use observation and water quality support in the display while fish are treated externally.

## If copper contamination already occurred

1. Stop dosing immediately.
2. Perform large staged water changes.
3. Use copper-removal media and monitor repeatedly.
4. Expect rebound from substrate/media release and continue tracking.

## Medication caution tiers

- Highest caution: copper, copper-formalin interaction risk
- High caution: formalin/malachite combinations in mixed invert tanks
- Conditional caution: lower-toxicity agents still require formulation and species review

## Safety note

Invertebrate-safe fish treatment is primarily a system-design decision (separate treatment tank), not a “perfect mixed-tank dosing” problem.
