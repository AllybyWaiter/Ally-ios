# Ammonia and Nitrite Emergency Runbook

## Objective

Provide a fast, repeatable protocol for ammonia and nitrite spikes in aquariums.

## Core principle

Treat this as an oxygen and toxicity emergency:

1. Restore oxygen first.
2. Stop adding waste.
3. Dilute toxins.
4. Support biofilter recovery.

## Immediate triggers

Start this runbook immediately if any of the following are true:

- Any measurable ammonia in an established tank.
- Any measurable nitrite in an established tank.
- Fish are gasping, hanging at the surface, or showing rapid respiration.
- Sudden filter interruption, heavy die-off, or overfeeding event.

## First 0 to 30 minutes

1. Maximize aeration and flow.
2. Stop feeding.
3. Remove dead fish, decaying food, and obvious detritus.
4. Verify test kit with a second test if results are surprising.
5. Record:
   - Temperature
   - pH
   - Ammonia (TAN)
   - Nitrite
   - Alkalinity/KH
   - Dissolved oxygen (if available)

## First 0 to 6 hours

1. Perform a water change sized to hit a target concentration.
2. Use conditioner/dechlorinator as needed for replacement water.
3. If ammonia is elevated, add a label-directed ammonia binder as a temporary bridge.
4. If nitrite is elevated in freshwater, consider chloride support (salt) when livestock is salt-tolerant.
5. Re-test after mixing and circulation.

## Water change sizing formula

If replacement water is clean:

- `required_change_fraction = 1 - (target / current)`

Examples:

- Current 1.0 ppm to target 0.25 ppm -> 75% change.
- Current 0.8 ppm to target 0.2 ppm -> 75% change.

## Nitrite chloride guardrail (freshwater only)

Use chloride support only when species compatibility is confirmed.

- Practical protection ratio: target chloride to nitrite of roughly `6:1` to `10:1`.
- This is supportive care, not a replacement for water changes and biofilter recovery.

## 6 to 48 hours stabilization

1. Keep aeration elevated.
2. Continue reduced or paused feeding until ammonia and nitrite are controlled.
3. Re-dose binder only per label interval.
4. Check KH/alkalinity and prevent a buffer crash.
5. Restore biofilter function (flow, oxygen, media integrity, and optional nitrifier inoculation).
6. Re-test at least every 12 to 24 hours.

## Recovery criteria

Consider the incident controlled when all are true for at least 48 hours:

- Ammonia: 0
- Nitrite: 0
- Fish behavior normalized
- No ongoing upward trend after feeding resumes lightly

## Root cause checklist

- New tank or immature biofilter
- Overfeeding or bioload jump
- Clogged or bypassed filtration
- Low oxygen
- Low alkalinity/KH
- Medication or chemical side-effects
- Decaying biomass

## Escalation

Escalate urgently if fish continue to decline despite two intervention cycles or if repeated spikes occur over multiple days.
