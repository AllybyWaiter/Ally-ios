# Filter Troubleshooting Decision Tree

## Objective

Provide a measurement-led decision workflow for diagnosing filter performance failures across aquarium, pool/spa, and related water systems.

## Core principle

Do not diagnose filter health from one symptom. Pair pressure, flow, and outcome quality.

1. Validate instrumentation first.
2. Classify symptom pattern.
3. Confirm root cause with targeted checks.
4. Verify post-fix performance and log baseline.

## High-signal inputs

- Differential pressure (or equivalent head loss)
- Flow rate and circulation behavior
- Downstream quality outcome (clarity/particles/system performance)
- Evidence of bypass, leaks, or media damage

## Symptom-to-cause map

### High pressure drop + low flow

- Likely loading/clogging, wrong media, or upstream solids surge

### Low pressure drop + poor quality

- Likely bypass, seal failure, channeling, or sensor error

### Low flow with normal pressure drop

- Restriction may be elsewhere (pump, valves, suction side, lines)

### Sudden pressure drop change

- Possible rupture/leak path or instrumentation fault

## Decision sequence

1. Safety isolate if pressurized/electrical hazards exist.
2. Validate gauges/sensors and sampling points.
3. Confirm flow and hydraulic status.
4. Inspect filter element/seals/housing integrity.
5. Correct and re-baseline pressure and flow.
6. Document root cause and prevention action.

## Preventive controls

- Trend pressure rise instead of calendar-only replacement
- Capture baseline after each media change
- Maintain instrumentation and ports
- Control upstream solids and biofilm drivers

## Safety note

Never open pressurized filter equipment without proper isolation and depressurization.
