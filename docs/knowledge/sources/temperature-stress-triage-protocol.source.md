# Temperature Stress Triage Protocol for Heat and Cold Emergencies

## Executive summary

Temperature stress emergencies are time-sensitive, physiology-driven syndromes where early triage decisions (recognition, severity classification, and immediate cooling/rewarming) strongly influence outcomes. The highest-risk entities are **heat stroke** and **moderate-to-severe hypothermia**, both of which require **rapid escalation, continuous monitoring, and usually hospital-based critical care** rather than “observe and transport later.” citeturn17view0turn9view0turn7view0turn20view0

For **heat stroke**, major guideline convergence is that the diagnosis is clinical and hinges on **central nervous system dysfunction** (confusion, seizures, coma) in the setting of heat exposure/exertion and **elevated core temperature (often ≥40°C / 104°F)**, though temperature may be variable and should not delay treatment when suspicion is high. citeturn9view0turn3search1turn19view0 The recommended triage priority is **immediate active cooling** (not passive measures) with modalities that cool fastest—especially cold/ice-water immersion when feasible—and to reach a target core temperature **<39°C** or approximately **38.5–39°C** quickly (commonly within ~30 minutes of recognition in modern guidance). citeturn17view0turn9view2turn13view1turn3search7 Pharmacologic antipyretics (acetaminophen/NSAIDs/salicylates) and dantrolene are **not recommended** for temperature reduction in heat stroke. citeturn17view0turn9view1turn9view3

For **hypothermia**, the core definition is **core temperature <35°C**. citeturn6view0turn20view0 Field triage uses clinical staging (mental status, shivering, hemodynamic stability) and core temperature when available. Widely used staging bands include mild (≈35–32°C), moderate (≈32–28°C), severe (<28°C), with other schemes subdividing further (e.g., “profound”). citeturn7view0turn13view4 Key high-risk features that drive escalation include **altered mental status**, **loss of shivering**, **ventricular dysrhythmias**, and **hypotension**; one endorsed decision rule recommends direct transport to an extracorporeal life support (ECLS) center when there are risk factors for imminent arrest such as **core temperature <30°C in young/healthy**, **<32°C in elderly or multiple comorbidities**, **ventricular dysrhythmias**, or **SBP <90 mmHg**. citeturn20view0

For **frostbite**, triage hinges on (1) **systemic hypothermia first** and (2) avoiding the well-established harm of **thaw–refreeze cycles**: **do not rewarm** a frozen limb in the field unless **refreezing can be reliably prevented**. citeturn16view0turn28view0 If rewarming is appropriate, multiple major protocols converge on **circulating water rewarming at ~37–39°C** until tissue becomes soft/pliable, plus analgesia and atraumatic protection (no rubbing/dry heat). citeturn16view0turn28view0turn28view1 For deep frostbite after rewarming, specialty pathways increasingly incorporate **iloprost** (recommended as soon as possible up to ~72 hours after rewarming in graded deep injuries) and **thrombolysis (tPA) early in selected severe cases**, typically within ~24 hours, at capable centers. citeturn4search8turn4search16turn24view0

Across both heat and cold protocols, the most operationally decisive triage actions are: **core temperature measurement strategy**, **timed reassessment to detect deterioration**, **contraindication awareness (e.g., antipyretics in heat stroke; thawing when refreezing risk exists in frostbite)**, and **disposition triggers (ED vs ICU vs ECLS/burn-capable transfer)**. citeturn17view0turn7view0turn28view0turn19view0

## Scope, definitions, and pathophysiology

This report covers **acute triage** of temperature stress due to environmental exposure or exertion: **heat exhaustion**, **heat stroke**, **hypothermia**, and **frostbite**. It assumes no single jurisdictional scope-of-practice, so legal thresholds and EMS permissions are described as variable where applicable.

### Heat exhaustion and heat stroke

**Heat illness** exists on a spectrum. A major wilderness guideline defines **heat exhaustion** as mild-to-moderate illness from heat exposure or exertion with symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, thirst, headache, nausea, dizziness, and myalgias; **core temperature may be normal or mildly elevated** but remains **<40°C** in this schema. citeturn8view0 By contrast, **heat stroke** is classically defined as **core temperature >40°C (104°F) with central nervous system abnormalities** such as encephalopathy, seizure, or coma, and it may be **classic** (passive exposure; often older adults) or **exertional** (high metabolic heat; often younger, active persons). citeturn8view0turn3search1

Pathophysiologically, heat stroke is not simply “overheating.” It involves thermoregulatory failure and a systemic inflammatory response with endothelial injury, coagulopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction; wilderness guidance describes a sepsis-like cytokine cascade potentially amplified by gastrointestinal hypoperfusion and endotoxin translocation. citeturn8view0turn3search1 This aligns with ED literature emphasizing that rapid cooling and supportive care reduce morbidity and mortality, while delays worsen outcomes. citeturn19view0

### Hypothermia and frostbite

**Accidental hypothermia** is an unintentional drop in core temperature to **≤35°C**. citeturn6view0turn20view0 It can be **primary** (environmental exposure in an otherwise healthy person) or **secondary** (triggered or accelerated by illness, intoxication, trauma, endocrine failure, or impaired thermoregulation). citeturn20view0turn6view0 Clinically, progressive hypothermia depresses metabolism and vital signs, increases dysrhythmia risk, and can culminate in cardiac arrest; out-of-hospital diagnosis may rely on clinical staging when accurate thermometry is not feasible. citeturn20view0turn7view1

**Frostbite** is a freezing injury where tissue freezing triggers ice crystal formation and microvascular injury; a wilderness guideline describes overlapping phases (prefreeze; freeze–thaw; vascular stasis; late ischemic) and highlights that refreezing after thawing worsens injury. citeturn25view0turn28view0 Contemporary reviews similarly describe freeze injury plus reperfusion-mediated inflammation and thrombosis that drive ischemia and necrosis. citeturn24view0

## Epidemiology and risk modifiers

### Epidemiology and burden

Extreme temperatures are increasing in frequency/intensity in many regions; a WHO climate–health fact sheet notes that heat-related mortality among people older than 65 increased substantially between early-2000s and 2017–2021, consistent with broad climate-health surveillance signals. citeturn5search24

In the U.S.-focused ED literature, heat-related mortality and morbidity are often undercounted because heat can precipitate decompensation in comorbid conditions that get coded as the primary diagnosis; an ED review gives one commonly cited estimate of hundreds of recorded heat deaths annually while emphasizing underestimation. citeturn19view0

For accidental hypothermia, an open-access 2021/2022 update reports that incidence varies widely by country (with many gaps in national surveillance), and provides illustrative ranges (e.g., European incidence spanning fractions to several cases per 100,000 per year) and U.S. figures including thousands of deaths and substantial annual hospital presentations, while stressing that global surveillance is incomplete. citeturn20view0

For frostbite, modern reviews state that true prevalence is uncertain and argue for better centralized databases, while noting higher rates in homeless individuals and certain worker/recreational populations. citeturn24view0

### High-risk populations, comorbidities, and medication effects

Major protocols and reviews converge that **risk is a function of exposure plus vulnerability**:

- **Heat vulnerability** increases in neonates/infants, older adults, and people with mental illness; model EMS guidance explicitly flags these groups. citeturn13view2 A clinical ED review adds pregnancy, chronic cardiovascular/respiratory/renal/psychiatric disease, socioeconomic vulnerability (housing and air-conditioning access), and occupational exposure as key risk amplifiers. citeturn19view0 WHO similarly stresses disproportionate risk in vulnerable populations during extreme heat. citeturn5search24
- **Medication-related heat risk** is driven by impaired sweating, altered salt/water balance, or impaired cardiovascular compensation; ED literature lists classes such as **diuretics**, **anticholinergics**, **beta-blockers**, **SSRIs**, and antidopaminergic agents as examples. citeturn19view0 Model EMS guidance similarly highlights “heart medications,” diuretics, psychiatric medications, and other substances as contributors to heat emergencies. citeturn13view2
- **Cold vulnerability** increases with extremes of age, low body mass/large surface area ratios (children), intoxication, trauma, homelessness, endocrine or CNS disease, and any condition that impairs shivering or behavioral self-rescue. citeturn20view0turn6view0 A CDC occupational cold-stress page frames frostbite risk in settings of inadequate protection and reduced circulation. citeturn5search6

These risk modifiers matter for triage because they lower the threshold for ED evaluation, increase likelihood of complications (rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, AKI in heat stroke; dysrhythmias and “rescue collapse” in hypothermia), and influence destination choice (ICU/ECLS/burn-capable center). citeturn19view0turn20view0turn7view0turn24view0

## Triage framework and severity stratification

### Core principles for both heat and cold triage

1. **Remove from the source** (hot environment or cold/wet/wind exposure) while maintaining scene safety. citeturn9view0turn7view1  
2. **Primary survey first (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) + glucose early**, because altered mental status in temperature illness overlaps with hypoglycemia, intoxication, sepsis, stroke, and toxic syndromes. citeturn9view0turn13view0turn19view0  
3. **Measure core temperature appropriately when it changes management**, but do not delay time-critical cooling/rewarming when suspicion is high. Rectal temperature is emphasized for heat stroke recognition in wilderness and ED pathways; for hypothermia, esophageal or well-insulated tympanic/epitympanic devices may be preferred depending on airway status and setting. citeturn9view0turn19view0turn20view0turn13view5  
4. **Severity is defined by organ dysfunction**, not exposure history alone: CNS dysfunction in heat illness; hemodynamic instability/dysrhythmia risk in hypothermia; tissue depth/extent for frostbite. citeturn3search1turn20view0turn24view0

### Validated and widely used severity stratification tools and criteria

**Heat stroke diagnostic criteria (classic clinical definition)**: core temperature often **>40°C** plus CNS dysfunction; wilderness guidelines present this definition and emphasize that absolute temperature alone is insufficient in asymptomatic exertional hyperthermia. citeturn8view0 A major review similarly describes the hallmark as CNS dysfunction with elevated core temperature. citeturn3search1turn19view0

**JAAM heat stroke criteria (Japan)**: registry-driven criteria define heat stroke without requiring a high temperature and classify heat stroke when patients meet at least one of: **GCS ≤14**, **creatinine or total bilirubin ≥1.2 mg/dL**, or **JAAM DIC score ≥4**, reflecting the concern that some high-risk patients (notably older adults) may not present with very high temperatures yet have organ dysfunction. citeturn3search0turn3search5turn3search8  
*Operational implication:* in ED triage, organ dysfunction and altered mentation should trigger heat stroke pathways even if the measured temperature is equivocal or partially treated. citeturn19view0turn3search8

**Hypothermia staging (field + EMS + wilderness)**: a wilderness guideline defines hypothermia at **≤35°C** and presents a practical staging approach: cold-stressed but not hypothermic (>35°C), mild (35–32°C), moderate (32–28°C), severe/profound (<28°C), with clinical signs (shivering, consciousness, function) used when temperature is unavailable. citeturn6view0turn7view0turn7view1 A model EMS guideline uses a similar but not identical temperature banding (mild 32.1–35°C; moderate 28.1–32°C; severe 24–28°C; profound <24°C) and explicitly notes shivering often ceases around 30–31°C. citeturn13view4turn15view0

**Hypothermia high-risk transfer rule (ECLS destination guidance)**: an endorsed update recommends direct transfer to an ECLS center for hypothermic patients with imminent arrest risk factors such as **T <30°C (young/healthy), T <32°C (elderly or multiple comorbidities), ventricular dysrhythmias, or SBP <90 mmHg**, as well as patients already in hypothermic arrest. citeturn20view0

**Frostbite classification**: out-of-hospital guidance often uses a practical two-tier (superficial vs deep) early; wilderness guidelines note that detailed “degrees” are difficult to assess pre-rewarming and support simplified field classification. citeturn25view0turn24view0 After rewarming, grade-based systems (e.g., Cauchy-derived approaches) are used to estimate tissue loss and guide therapies such as thrombolysis/vasodilators, but availability and exact grading implementation varies by center. citeturn24view0turn4search16turn4search8

## Heat-related illness field and ED triage

### Clinical presentation and severity stratification

**Heat exhaustion** typically presents with fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, thirst, and sometimes syncope, with preserved mentation or only mild symptoms; it can progress to heat stroke if the person remains hot or dehydrated. citeturn8view0turn5search20

**Heat stroke** presents with **CNS dysfunction** (confusion, agitation, seizures, coma) plus hyperthermia and systemic compromise that may include hypotension and dysrhythmias; it is time-critical because duration of hyperthermia correlates with risk of organ injury. citeturn3search1turn19view0turn13view2

### Validated triage triggers and vital-sign thresholds

**Field trigger (model EMS):** start active cooling if **core temperature >104°F (40°C)** **or** **altered mental status** is present. citeturn13view0

**Cooling endpoint (model EMS):** continue cooling until **<102.2°F (39°C)**, or—if continuous temp monitoring is not available—until **improvement in mental status**. citeturn13view1

**Cooling endpoint (wilderness heat guideline):** cool heat stroke patients to **no less than 39°C** (operationally: stop active cooling around 39°C). citeturn9view2

**Cooling endpoint (athletic exertional heat guideline):** continue cooling until rectal temperature lowers to about **38.9°C (102°F)** (exertional focus). citeturn3search7

**Critical-care operational targets:** prioritize rapid cooling strategies that achieve target temperature **<39°C** within **30 minutes** and cooling rate **≥0.155°C/min** when feasible. citeturn17view0

### Field triage and prehospital interventions

**Immediate actions (field):**
- Move to shade/cool environment; remove restrictive clothing; reduce conductive heat sources. citeturn9view0turn13view0
- Obtain glucose early in altered mental status. citeturn13view0turn19view0
- If heat stroke suspected, **cooling takes priority** over lower-urgency tasks (e.g., IV placement), per EMS model guidance. citeturn13view2turn17view0

**Preferred cooling modalities (prehospital/early care):**
- **Cold/ice-water immersion** is consistently the fastest method and prioritized in both wilderness and critical-care guidance when feasible. citeturn9view1turn17view0
- **Field-expedient alternatives** include **tarp-assisted cooling with oscillation (TACO)** or rotating ice-water towels when immersion is not available; these appear explicitly in model EMS guidance. citeturn13view0
- Evidence from controlled studies shows TACO can achieve clinically meaningful cooling rates (on the order of ~0.14°C/min in one study of exertional hyperthermia), supporting its role as a resource-limited substitute when tubs are impractical. citeturn29search1turn17view0

image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"16:9","query":["cold water immersion heat stroke treatment","tarp assisted cooling oscillation TACO method","hypothermia burrito wrap technique","frostbite warm water bath rewarming"],"num_per_query":1}

**Adjuncts and supportive care:**
- **Cold IV fluids** may be used as an adjunct when available but are not sufficient as the primary cooling strategy in heat stroke. citeturn9view2
- For seizures, treat per seizure protocols; for shivering that prevents effective cooling, model EMS guidance permits benzodiazepines (dose and permission are protocol-dependent). citeturn13view1
- Anticipate complications (arrhythmia, shock) and monitor accordingly. citeturn13view1turn19view0

**Contraindications / “don’ts” (prehospital):**
- Avoid routine temperature-lowering pharmacologics (acetaminophen/NSAIDs/salicylates) and avoid dantrolene for heat stroke temperature control. citeturn17view0turn9view1turn9view3
- Avoid strategies that risk delaying definitive cooling (e.g., transport-first when effective on-scene cooling is available and safe), because delays are associated with worse outcomes in ED literature and modern pathway proposals. citeturn19view0turn17view0
- Model EMS warns against applying wet cloths/wet clothing that can trap heat and impair evaporative cooling in some situations. citeturn13view1

### ED triage decision rules, monitoring, and disposition

**ED triage logic (operationalized):**
- Initiate a “heat alert” style process (analogous to trauma/stroke alerts) when a patient presents with heat exposure/exertion plus **CNS dysfunction** and/or markedly elevated temperature, because timely cooling and coordinated resources are repeatedly associated with improved outcomes. citeturn19view0
- If heat stroke is suspected, ED literature recommends starting treatment immediately, even while ruling out mimics (sepsis, stroke, intoxication). citeturn19view0turn3search1

**Monitoring and reassessment intervals:**
- Modern guidelines consistently imply **continuous temperature monitoring during active cooling** and frequent reassessment, but explicit universal minute-by-minute intervals are not standardized across all major sources reviewed. citeturn17view0turn13view1turn3search7  
- Practical, protocol-compatible operationalization used by many services is:
  - During active cooling: **continuous core temperature** and **cardiac monitoring**, with vitals and mental status reassessment **every ~5 minutes** until stable (this is a pragmatic interval; your local protocol may specify differently). This recommendation is consistent with “monitor ongoing / regular intervals” language in EMS and athletic guidance but is not uniformly codified as a validated interval. citeturn13view0turn3search7turn17view0

**Disposition criteria (heat):**
- **Heat stroke:** transport/triage as high acuity; expect admission and frequently ICU because of risk for multiorgan failure and coagulopathy described in wilderness and ED literature. citeturn9view1turn19view0turn17view0
- **Heat exhaustion:** may be discharged after symptom resolution, stable vitals, and no concerning complications; however, discharge criteria vary by institution and population risk, and persistent symptoms or worsening should trigger escalation/ED-level evaluation. citeturn9view0turn5search28turn5search20  
  *If a specific discharge algorithm is needed, it must be jurisdiction- and institution-specific; no single global discharge rule is universally specified in the major sources above.*

## Cold-related illness field and ED triage

### Hypothermia presentation, staging, and risk stratification

A wilderness guideline defines accidental hypothermia as core temperature ≤35°C and provides an out-of-hospital decision algorithm that distinguishes cold stress (>35°C) from mild/moderate/severe hypothermia using shivering, consciousness, and core temperature when available. citeturn6view0turn7view0turn7view1

Model EMS guidance similarly emphasizes that mild hypothermia may present with normal mentation and preserved shivering, while moderate-to-severe hypothermia presents with mental status change, eventual loss of shivering, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression; it also instructs rescuers to check pulses longer than normal, up to 60 seconds. citeturn13view3turn13view4turn13view5

A widely cited hypothermia update recommends ECLS-center transport for patients with imminent arrest risk factors: **temperature <30°C** (young/healthy) or **<32°C** (elderly/multiple comorbidities), **ventricular dysrhythmias**, or **SBP <90 mmHg**, and for patients already in hypothermic arrest. citeturn20view0

Operationally, a model EMS guideline advises transporting moderate/severe hypothermia patients as soon as possible to hospitals capable of resuscitation and considering ECLS-capable centers if arrest occurs (feasibility dependent). citeturn16view0

### Prehospital interventions and contraindications

**Mild hypothermia (stable, shivering, normal mentation):**
- Remove from cold/wet; dry; insulate from ground/wind; use a vapor barrier and warm environment when feasible. citeturn13view4turn7view1
- Provide calories (warm drinks/food containing glucose) if awake and airway-protective; shivering heat production requires energy substrate. citeturn13view4turn7view1turn20view0
- Use external rewarming focused on the trunk (heat packs/forced-air warming if available), with burn prevention (barriers; periodic checks). citeturn13view4turn16view0

**Moderate/severe hypothermia (AMS, no shivering, instability):**
- **Handle gently; keep horizontal.** Sudden exertion or standing can precipitate collapse; both wilderness and EMS algorithms emphasize no standing/walking and careful movement. citeturn7view0turn16view0turn13view5
- Warmed oxygen may be used when oxygen is needed; model EMS guidance suggests warming to ~40–42°C if feasible. citeturn13view4turn13view5
- Establish IV/IO as feasible and give **warmed isotonic crystalloids**; model EMS guidance specifies warming IV fluids ideally to ~42°C. citeturn13view4turn13view5
- Continuous ECG monitoring whenever possible because of dysrhythmia risk. citeturn13view5turn20view0

**Hypothermic cardiac arrest:**
- **Check for breathing/pulse for up to 60 seconds** before declaring arrest and initiating CPR. citeturn7view0turn13view3turn13view5
- A wilderness algorithm emphasizes that there is **no temperature cut-off for CPR**, that CPR may be delayed/intermittent in some evacuation contexts, and provides a termination trigger if serum potassium is extremely high (example: terminate CPR if **K+ >12 mmol/L** in their protocol). citeturn7view0
- Model EMS guidance summarizes differing approaches to defibrillation at core temperatures <30°C and notes medication strategies may be modified and sometimes withheld until core temperature rises above 30°C, depending on protocol lineage. citeturn16view1turn7view0  
  *Because resuscitation in hypothermia is protocol-sensitive and scope-of-practice varies, local medical direction is required for exact defibrillation/drug timing.*

### Frostbite triage, interventions, and contraindications

**Field triage priorities:**
1. Treat systemic hypothermia and serious trauma first. citeturn28view1turn16view0  
2. Protect the frozen part from mechanical trauma; remove jewelry; pad/splint as needed. citeturn28view1turn24view0  
3. Decide whether thawing is safe: **do not thaw** if you cannot prevent refreezing (e.g., evacuation requires travel in freezing conditions). citeturn16view0turn28view0

**If thawing is appropriate:**
- Use **circulating water 37–39°C** (thermometer-based if possible) until tissue becomes **red/purple and soft/pliable**; avoid fires/space heaters/ovens due to burn risk and numb tissue. citeturn28view0turn28view1turn16view0
- Provide analgesia; consider ibuprofen as used in wilderness frostbite guidance (dose and contraindications are patient-specific). citeturn28view1turn28view0
- **Do not rub/massage** frostbitten tissue. citeturn16view0turn24view0turn28view1
- Dress loosely with dry sterile/bulky dressings; elevate if possible; avoid ambulation on thawed lower extremity when feasible due to trauma risk. citeturn28view1turn28view0

**Specialty-care escalation (post-rewarming, deep frostbite):**
- Contemporary care pathways describe use of **tPA** for severe frostbite in selected patients early after rewarming (often within ~24 hours in grade 3–4 schemes) and **iloprost** for deep frostbite in grade 2–4 injuries up to ~72 hours post-rewarming, within specialized protocols. citeturn4search16turn24view0turn4search8  
- A WMS summary notes **iloprost** approval in the U.S. and recommends using it for deep frostbite extending to distal interphalangeal joint or more proximal (grades 2–4) as soon as possible, up to 72 hours after rewarming. citeturn4search8  
- These therapies require center capability for imaging, bleeding risk assessment, and monitoring; thus they are primarily **transfer decisions**, not first-responder interventions. citeturn24view0turn4search16

### Disposition criteria (cold)

- **Cold-stressed, not hypothermic (>35°C), functioning normally:** may not require hospital if reliable shelter, rewarming, and observation exist; wilderness guidance explicitly notes that uninjured, alert, shivering patients may not need hospital, while trauma or asphyxia changes this. citeturn7view0
- **Mild hypothermia:** often requires ED evaluation if there is trauma, comorbidity, inability to rewarm, or clinical decline; model EMS recommends hospital transport capable of rewarming. citeturn13view4turn13view5
- **Moderate/severe hypothermia or any instability:** high-acuity ED/ICU disposition; consider direct ECLS center based on risk criteria. citeturn20view0turn16view0turn7view0
- **Frostbite:** grade/severity drives disposition; superficial frostbite may be managed without advanced intervention, while deep frostbite requires ED evaluation and often specialty referral/transfer for thrombolysis/vasodilator consideration. citeturn28view1turn4search16turn24view0

## First-responder checklist and recommended tests

### First-responder checklist

**Universal**
- Ensure scene safety; remove patient from heat/cold exposure. citeturn9view0turn7view1  
- ABCs, pulse oximetry if available, and focused neurologic status; check glucose early in altered mental status. citeturn13view0turn19view0  
- Obtain core temperature if it changes management and is feasible (rectal emphasized for heat stroke; insulated epitympanic/esophageal options for hypothermia depending on setting). citeturn9view0turn13view5turn20view0  
- Reassess frequently and document exposures, duration, clothing, exertion, and medications/substances. citeturn13view2turn13view4turn19view0  

**Heat**
- Trigger heat stroke pathway if altered mental status or temp ≥40°C/104°F (protocol-dependent). citeturn13view0turn9view0  
- Start active cooling immediately; cold/ice-water immersion if feasible; otherwise use field-expedient alternatives (e.g., tarp-assisted oscillation or rotating ice-water towels). citeturn13view0turn17view0turn29search1  
- Stop cooling around 38.5–39°C (source-dependent) to avoid overshoot hypothermia. citeturn17view0turn9view2turn13view1turn3search7  
- Avoid antipyretics/dantrolene for temperature control. citeturn17view0turn9view1turn9view3  

**Cold**
- If moderate/severe hypothermia suspected: handle gently, keep horizontal; avoid standing/walking/exertion. citeturn7view0turn16view0turn13view5  
- Pulse check up to 60 seconds before declaring arrest. citeturn13view5turn7view0  
- Prevent further heat loss: remove wet clothing, insulate, vapor barrier; active trunk warming with burn precautions. citeturn13view4turn7view1turn16view0  
- If frostbite: do not rub; do not thaw if refreezing risk; if thawing is safe, circulate water 37–39°C and protect after thaw. citeturn16view0turn28view0turn24view0  

### Recommended vital signs and laboratory tests with targets

Because the user requested “target values,” this section separates (A) **targets explicitly specified in major guidelines** from (B) **general ED resuscitation targets**, which are widely used but not uniformly specified across the temperature-stress guidelines in the sources reviewed.

#### Guideline-specified targets and thresholds

| Item | Where used | Target / threshold | Primary rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core temperature cooling endpoint | Heat stroke | Stop cooling at ~38.9–39°C (source-dependent) citeturn17view0turn9view2turn13view1turn3search7 | Avoid afterdrop/iatrogenic hypothermia while reducing thermal injury risk |
| Cooling time and rate targets | Heat stroke | Reach <39°C within ~30 min; cooling rate ≥0.155°C/min (critical-care guidance) citeturn17view0 | Time-to-cooling is a key determinant of outcomes |
| Pulse check duration | Hypothermia | Up to 60 seconds citeturn13view5turn7view0 | Bradycardia/low-flow states can be missed with short checks |
| ECLS destination threshold | Hypothermia (imminent arrest risk) | Direct to ECLS center if T <30°C (young/healthy) or <32°C (elderly/comorbid), ventricular dysrhythmia, or SBP <90 citeturn20view0 | Prevent arrest / enable rapid extracorporeal rewarming |
| Warmed oxygen temperature | Hypothermia (when O₂ needed) | Warm/humidify to ~40–42°C if feasible citeturn13view4turn13view5 | Reduce further cooling; improve comfort |
| Warmed IV fluid temperature | Hypothermia | Warm isotonic crystalloids ideally ~42°C citeturn13view5 | Prevent iatrogenic cooling; support perfusion |
| Frostbite water bath temperature | Frostbite thawing | Circulating water 37–39°C citeturn16view0turn28view0turn28view1 | Rapid thaw with burn risk control in numb tissue |
| Thrombolysis/vasodilator windows (center-dependent) | Deep frostbite | tPA typically within ~24h (selected severe cases); iloprost up to ~72h after rewarming citeturn4search16turn4search8turn24view0 | Microvascular thrombosis mitigation; tissue salvage |

#### Core ED/prehospital tests commonly recommended in reviewed pathways

- **Heat stroke ED workup bundle (typical in ED pathways):** CBC, CMP/electrolytes, CK, coagulation studies (PT/INR ± fibrinogen), urinalysis, and consideration of lactate; ED heatstroke pathways also emphasize urine output monitoring (e.g., Foley) and careful fluid strategy due to pulmonary edema risk. citeturn19view0  
- **Hypothermia evaluation:** core temperature measurement method selection is emphasized, along with ECG monitoring and electrolytes; the hypothermia update highlights that staging and arrest-risk assessment rely on clinical signs + core temp, and that comorbid intoxication/trauma complicates interpretation. citeturn20view0turn13view5turn7view0  
- **Frostbite at-capable-center evaluation:** assessment after rewarming, consideration of imaging for perfusion deficit, and lab monitoring if thrombolytics are used; reviews describe protocols that monitor CBC/platelets/fibrinogen/PTT during tPA pathways. citeturn24view0turn4search16  

If you need a single “global” numeric target set for labs (e.g., sodium, potassium, creatinine thresholds) beyond those above, that is **not uniformly specified** across the major temperature-stress triage guidelines reviewed and must be aligned to your institution’s reference ranges and critical-care protocols; where specific cutoffs exist (e.g., hypothermia arrest potassium thresholds in some algorithms), they are context- and protocol-dependent. citeturn7view0turn20view0turn19view0

## Special populations, resource-limited adaptations, and legal and ethical considerations

### Pediatric and geriatric modifications

**Pediatrics**
- Children are explicitly recognized in EMS model guidance as high-risk for heat emergencies (including scenarios such as confinement in vehicles) and should be presumed hyperthermic when they exhibit altered mental status with elevated temperature in that context. citeturn13view0turn13view2  
- For hypothermia, physiologic susceptibility is higher in children and small adults due to large surface area-to-mass ratios, which accelerates heat loss and lowers the threshold for rapid decline. citeturn20view0  
Operationally, pediatric triage should use **lower thresholds for escalation**, ensure weight-based dosing (fluids/benzodiazepines), and prioritize rapid core temperature assessment because mental status signs can be subtle and overlap with pediatric hypoglycemia or infection. citeturn13view1turn19view0turn20view0

**Geriatrics**
- Older adults are high risk for classic heat stroke and for secondary hypothermia, particularly indoors with comorbidities and medication effects; this drives lower thresholds for ED/ICU disposition and affects ECLS transfer triggers (e.g., <32°C used in one hypothermia update for elderly/comorbid arrest risk). citeturn19view0turn20view0turn5search24  
- EMS and ED protocols should assume reduced physiologic reserve and greater probability of concurrent infection, dehydration, or polypharmacy. citeturn13view2turn20view0

### Resource-limited and mass-casualty adaptations

**Heat (resource-limited cooling):**
- Model EMS guidance includes tarp-assisted cooling and rotating ice-water towels as alternates to immersion. citeturn13view0  
- Controlled studies support that tarp-assisted cooling can achieve clinically acceptable cooling rates for exertional hyperthermia and is operationally feasible where tubs/space are limited. citeturn29search1turn29search0turn17view0  
- Because critical-care guidance prioritizes methods with cooling rate ≥0.155°C/min and target <39°C within 30 minutes, resource-limited plans should pre-identify which local methods meet these targets and train teams accordingly. citeturn17view0turn29search1

**Cold (resource-limited rewarming):**
- Wilderness hypothermia guidance provides “cold card” decision aids and describes insulation/vapor barriers and the hypothermia wrap method (“burrito”) using common materials. citeturn7view1turn7view2  
- Model EMS protocols emphasize vapor barriers, trunk-focused heat, and warmed compartments (e.g., warming ambulance compartment to ~24°C when feasible) in severe cases. citeturn16view0turn7view0

**Mass-casualty temperature events (heat waves/cold snaps):**
- Temperature disasters create predictable surges and can be approached as **event-driven surge planning**: decanting low-acuity ED volume, expanding cooling/rewarming capacity, and establishing rapid identification pathways (“heat alerts”) are highlighted in ED systems literature. citeturn19view0turn29search32  
- In crisis conditions, triage must also consider constrained resources and staff, aligning with crisis standards of care frameworks rather than ordinary individual-focused optimization. citeturn29search14turn29search3

### Legal and ethical considerations

No single legal framework applies globally; jurisdictional rules for EMS authority, refusal, and involuntary transport vary. However, model EMS guidance provides operationally relevant ethical–legal structure:
- Determine decision-making capacity when care/transport is refused, recognizing impairment from illness/injury/intoxication; document risks explained and medical direction involvement when capacity is uncertain. citeturn18view0  
- For minors when guardians are unavailable, EMS may act under emergency exception / implied consent when immediate threats exist and delay is unsafe (jurisdictionally variable but widely recognized in EMS guidance). citeturn18view0turn18view1

For **mass-casualty or resource scarcity**, ethical guidance emphasizes transparency, fairness, stewardship, and using ethically relevant criteria such as likelihood of benefit and urgency; entity["organization","American Medical Association","medical ethics, us"] guidance and U.S. federal emergency preparedness resources provide frameworks for crisis standards planning (not temperature-specific but operationally applicable to heat-wave ICU demand). citeturn29search3turn29search14turn29search10

## Evidence gaps and research priorities

Despite strong consensus on many operational steps, several evidence gaps persist:

- **Heat stroke cooling evidence quality:** Critical-care guidance rates certainty of evidence as very low while still issuing strong operational recommendations favoring active cooling, reflecting reliance on observational data, physiology, and indirect comparisons rather than large RCTs. citeturn17view0 Wilderness heat guidelines similarly note that much of the evidence base is case series or extrapolation from exertional hyperthermia models, with limited controlled comparisons in classic heat stroke. citeturn9view3turn9view2
- **Pharmacologic adjuncts in heat stroke:** Major guidelines converge that there is no evidence supporting pharmacologic temperature-control agents (and recommend avoidance), but whether selected immunomodulatory strategies could reduce organ injury remains largely research-only. citeturn17view0turn9view3
- **Prehospital/ED systems implementation:** ED literature identifies lack of scalable, standardized EMS–ED alert workflows for heat stroke despite strong time-dependence of outcomes, and calls for system-level protocols and evaluation. citeturn19view0
- **Hypothermia rewarming outside ECLS:** Hypothermia experts emphasize that when ECLS is unavailable, non-ECLS rewarming strategies are used but robust comparative data are limited, especially for cardiac arrest contexts and prolonged field care. citeturn20view0turn7view0
- **Frostbite epidemiology and comparative effectiveness:** Reviews note unknown true incidence/prevalence and heterogeneity in grading, imaging access, and therapeutic protocols; while thrombolysis and iloprost show promise, implementation depends on expertise and resources, and high-quality comparative trials remain limited. citeturn24view0turn4search8turn4search16
- **Special populations:** Pediatric- and geriatric-specific evidence for optimal cooling/rewarming rates, endpoints, and adverse-effect balance is less mature than adult data, and many recommendations remain consensus-driven. citeturn13view2turn20view0turn9view3
