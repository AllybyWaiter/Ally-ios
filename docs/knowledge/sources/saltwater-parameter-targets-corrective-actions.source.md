# Saltwater Aquarium Parameter Targets and Corrective Actions

## Executive summary

Stable water chemistry matters more than chasing “perfect” single readings, because most marine livestock (especially corals) respond poorly to rapid swings even when the final number is “in range.” This report therefore treats **targets + stability + measurement quality** as a single control system: verify the reading, correct safely, then prevent recurrence with process controls (RO/DI quality, consistent dosing, feeding/export balance, and calibrated instrumentation). citeturn6view1turn31view2turn8view1

Across reefkeeping sources that publish explicit targets, the most consequential **daily life-support parameters** cluster around: **temperature ~23–29 °C (73–84 °F) with minimal fluctuation**, **salinity ~35 ppt (PSU≈35; SG≈1.026 at 25 °C)**, **pH ~7.8–8.3**, **alkalinity commonly ~7–11 dKH depending on nutrient regime**, **calcium ~400–450 mg/L**, **magnesium ~1,200–1,400 mg/L**, **ammonia & nitrite = 0**, **nitrate and phosphate kept low-but-not-starved for most reefs**, and **dissolved oxygen (DO) >5 mg/L (ideally near saturation, ~6.75 mg/L at 25 °C and 35 ppt).** citeturn14search0turn31view2turn6view1turn9view0turn25search3turn26search2

When problems occur, the highest-risk triage order is:

1) **Immediate lethality / acute stress:** temperature spikes, salinity errors, low DO, and measurable ammonia. citeturn31view2turn14search0turn11search9turn15search2  
2) **Systemic instability drivers:** alkalinity/pH/CO₂ imbalance; equipment/automation failures; contaminated source water (metals). citeturn6view1turn7search6turn31view1  
3) **Chronic nutrient and clarity issues:** nitrate/phosphate imbalance, persistent turbidity, silicate-driven diatoms, ORP/organics management. citeturn9view0turn31view0turn16search0turn15search2

Finally, many published “reef targets” differ by intent (mixed reef vs SPS-dominant vs ULNS vs fish-only). Manufacturer programs explicitly provide different setpoints (e.g., **Red Sea Reef Care Program** tables for foundation elements and nutrients), so this report presents **optimal** and **acceptable** ranges and calls out where the target depends strongly on system type. citeturn6view1turn9view0

## Scope, assumptions, and constraints

**Unspecified by request:** tank volume, sump/no-sump, nutrient export design (skimmer/refugium/algae scrubber), automation (ATO/dosing pumps), substrate type, and livestock category (reef vs fish-only vs coral frag system). This report therefore provides (a) **reef-capable tropical marine** guidance with clear fish-only allowances where credible sources explicitly publish them, and (b) conservative change-rate guidance where rapid correction itself can be harmful. citeturn14search0turn6view1turn31view2

**Important measurement constraint:** many “parameters” are **operational definitions** tied to a method (e.g., “salinity” may be refractometer-based, conductivity-derived PSU, or hydrometer SG; “ammonia” may be TAN vs free NH₃; “phosphate” may be PO₄ vs phosphorus). Always record (1) **method**, (2) **unit**, and (3) **calibration/standard used** along with the value. citeturn31view2turn8view1turn27search3turn17search3

**Safety constraints:** This is husbandry/engineering guidance (not veterinary diagnosis). Any medication (notably copper) should be assumed **unsafe for reef displays** and typically belongs in quarantine/hospital systems, following the specific product’s label constraints and a compatible test method. citeturn5view3turn15search0turn31view1

## Target ranges and monitoring cadence

### Units and conversions that prevent common mistakes

**Salinity / SG / PSU**
- **PSS-78 practical salinity** is a **dimensionless** quantity derived from conductivity ratios; in practice, aquarium devices may label this as PSU. citeturn2search8turn2search14  
- A common reef reference point is **35 ppt**, which corresponds to **SG ≈ 1.0264 at 25 °C (77 °F)** when using seawater-calibrated standards. citeturn17search12turn17search3  
- Best practice is calibrating salinity tools using a **35 ppt standard** (not RO/DI water), because it calibrates at the point of use; multiple manufacturers sell traceable 35 ppt standards. citeturn17search3turn17search5  

**Alkalinity**
- Alkalinity is commonly expressed as **meq/L** or **dKH**, with the relationship **dKH = meq/L × 2.8** published in manufacturer documentation. citeturn6view1  

**Nitrate / phosphate reporting**
- Some test kits report **nitrate-nitrogen (N–NO₃)** or **phosphate-phosphorus (P–PO₄)** rather than NO₃⁻ or PO₄³⁻. A manufacturer table explicitly provides conversions between NO₃ and N–NO₃, and between PO₄ and P–PO₄ (conceptually reflecting molecular-weight ratios). citeturn8view1turn31view2  

### Concise actionable reference table

The table below is designed for “what should I test, what should it be, what usually causes it, what do I do first, and how often should I watch it.” Targets are presented as **Optimal (reef-capable)** and **Acceptable (broader / fish-only where explicitly supported).**

## Measurement methods and instrumentation

### Instrumentation overview and what each tool really measures

**Temperature control and logging**
- Minimum instrumentation: a reliable heater plus an independent thermometer; best practice is a controller with alarms and logging, because failures are common hazard modes in aquatic systems. citeturn31view2turn32search0turn32search2

**Salinity**
- **Refractometers/hydrometers** infer salinity from refractive index/density; accuracy depends on calibration at 35 ppt and temperature reference standards. citeturn17search3turn17search12  
- **Conductivity “salinity” probes** measure conductivity (EC) and compute practical salinity; they must be calibrated with appropriate conductivity/salinity standards and are sensitive to bubbles, fouling, and electrical interference. citeturn27search3turn17search7

**pH and ORP**
- pH and ORP probes drift and foul; routine calibration/verification with standards is normal laboratory practice. For saltwater pH, calibration with **pH 7 & 10** buffers is explicitly recommended by a controller manufacturer. citeturn27search1turn27search0  
- ORP probes often aren’t truly two-point calibrated in hobby controllers; verification with **240 mV and 470 mV** solutions is common because it checks electrode response and drift. citeturn10search1turn10search9turn2search5  

**Alkalinity / Ca / Mg**
- These are most reliably measured via **titration** (manual kits) or **photometric “checker”** methods; both require clean vials, consistent technique, and awareness of resolution limits published by manufacturers. citeturn6view2turn27search2turn6view0  

**Nutrients (NO₃ / PO₄)**
- For low-phosphate reefs, use **ultra-low range phosphate methods**; a manufacturer notes phosphate is important because excess can drive algae and deplete DO (indirectly via biological oxygen demand). citeturn19search2turn15search2  
- Always document whether a test reports NO₃ vs NO₃‑N, and PO₄ vs P, to avoid a 3–4× reporting error. citeturn8view1turn31view2

**Dissolved oxygen**
- DO can be measured via **electrochemical** (Clark-type, galvanic/polarographic) or **optical** sensors; manufacturers describe these as distinct technologies with different maintenance and response characteristics. citeturn16search1turn31view2

**Trace elements and contaminants**
- Practical in-home testing for many trace elements is limited; **ICP‑OES** services are designed to quantify large panels of macro/minor/trace elements and heavy metals, and manufacturers instruct dosing trace supplements based on ICP results and safe daily correction limits. citeturn1search12turn5view1turn1search8

### Practical testing cadence (a defensible baseline)

A cadence consistent with published manufacturer programs is:

- **Continuous:** temperature, pH (if probe), salinity (if conductivity), ORP (if used). citeturn32search0turn27search3turn10search0  
- **Daily to several times per week (reef):** alkalinity during dialing-in and any time dosing is changed; some programs explicitly assume **daily supplementation** and publish maximum daily increases. citeturn6view1turn6view0  
- **Weekly:** nitrate and phosphate during nutrient management; one nutrients program specifies weekly testing during adjustment and at least twice weekly during low-nutrient tuning, then weekly once stable. citeturn8view1  
- **Problem-driven:** ammonia and nitrite in established tanks (but daily during cycling, after disruptions, or if livestock stress is observed). citeturn31view2turn30search3  
- **Monthly to quarterly:** magnesium, and ICP trace panels if dosing trace elements or diagnosing unexplained issues. citeturn26search3turn1search12turn5view1  

## Corrective actions and prevention playbook

This section is organized as: **what drives deviation → immediate correction steps → prevention controls → safe change limits + calculation examples.** Where dosing limits are product-specific, the report uses manufacturer-published limits rather than hobby folklore.

### Foundation chemistry: alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, and pH

**Core causality to remember:** Alkalinity changes faster than calcium on a percentage basis, and pH interacts strongly with carbonate chemistry and precipitation risk. citeturn1search7turn1search1

**Alkalinity (dKH / meq/L)**
- Common reasons alkalinity runs **low:** insufficient dosing for demand; new aragonite substrate increasing abiotic precipitation; inconsistent daily dosing. citeturn6view2turn1search1turn6view1  
- Common reasons alkalinity runs **high:** overdosed buffer/2‑part, miscalibrated dosing pump, “pH chasing” with carbonate. citeturn1search1turn31view2  
- **Immediate corrective action (low alkalinity):**  
  1) Retest alkalinity. If the number is surprising, confirm with a second method or known standard (checker calibration/verification sets exist for some instruments). citeturn27search2turn6view0  
  2) Calculate the required correction dose for **net water volume** (display + sump − displacement). citeturn6view1turn6view0  
  3) Dose into high flow, ideally sump, in divided portions; avoid localized precipitation. citeturn6view1turn1search1  
  4) Re-test after full mixing (often 30–120 minutes depending on system flow), then re-evaluate daily consumption. citeturn6view1turn31view2  
- **Prevention:** set a fixed testing time; automate dosing in many small increments; log daily consumption; keep magnesium adequate to reduce precipitation risk. citeturn6view1turn25search3turn1search7  

**Calcium (mg/L)**
- **Corrective action (low calcium):** correct with a calcium supplement (often calcium chloride-based) while monitoring alkalinity; published safe daily calcium increases exist (manufacturer program limit and an independent chemistry expert’s conservative limit). citeturn6view1turn3search1  
- **Prevention:** dose balanced systems (2‑part, kalkwasser, reactor, or “all‑in‑one”) and verify that alkalinity is stable first. citeturn6view1turn1search26  

**Magnesium (mg/L)**
- Magnesium supports stability by influencing calcium carbonate saturation (“ion pairing” and precipitation behavior). citeturn23view0turn25search3  
- **Corrective action (low magnesium):** verify salinity; dose according to product or a conservative daily increment; recheck after mixing; monitor salinity because large Mg additions can nudge ionic strength. citeturn6view1turn3search2turn25search3  

**pH**
- pH depression is often driven by excess CO₂ in indoor air and inadequate gas exchange; one reefkeeping article focuses on indoor air quality as a root driver. citeturn7search6turn14search2  
- **Corrective action (low pH):** calibrate probe; measure alkalinity; improve aeration/skimming air; consider supplying fresh outdoor air. citeturn27search1turn7search6turn6view1  
- **Avoid:** aggressive “pH up / pH down” swings; if alkalinity is acceptable, prioritize CO₂ management over buffer dumping. citeturn31view2turn7search6  

### Nitrogen cycle triage: ammonia, nitrite, nitrate

**Why ammonia is urgent:** only **unionized NH₃** is strongly toxic; its fraction rises as pH and temperature rise. Aquaculture and veterinary references emphasize interpreting ammonia as TAN vs NH₃ and recognize that pH and temperature control toxicity. citeturn11search16turn31view2turn11search9

**Ammonia (TAN / NH₃) emergency protocol (reef or fish-only)**
1) **Stop feeding** immediately (reduce new nitrogen input). citeturn31view2  
2) **Maximize oxygenation** (add air stones, increase surface agitation, ensure skimmer is running unless a bacteria product label says otherwise). Low DO is a major mortality driver and nitrification itself demands oxygen. citeturn31view2turn15search2  
3) **Large water change** with matched salinity and temperature; this dilutes TAN and any co-occurring toxins. citeturn31view2turn6view1  
4) **Add nitrifiers** (live nitrifying bacteria) per label; one nitrifier product label specifies dosage and notes it can be used up to 5× to decrease cycling time, with operational constraints (remove chlorine/chloramine; turn off UV; avoid overcrowding/overfeeding). citeturn30search3turn30search7  
5) **Consider an ammonia binder** as a temporary bridge if livestock is at risk; one manufacturer states its conditioner “binds” ammonia (not removing it) and can be dosed every 24–48 h; another binder product claims multi-day persistence. Use strictly per label and understand test interactions. citeturn30search0turn30search1turn30search2  
6) **Find the source** (dead animal, failed filter, disturbed sand bed) and remove it. citeturn31view2  

**Nitrite**
- Veterinary reference tables list **0 mg/L** nitrite as normal for saltwater systems. citeturn31view2  
- Mechanistically, chloride competes with nitrite at fish gills; the general fish toxicology literature repeatedly identifies chloride as a key modifier of nitrite toxicity. Saltwater’s high chloride therefore reduces (but does not eliminate) fish risk, and nitrite still indicates biofilter disruption. citeturn28search17turn28search0turn31view2  
- Corrective action remains “fix nitrification,” not “treat the number”: reduce feeding, water change, restore biofilter capacity and oxygenation. citeturn31view2turn15search2  

**Nitrate**
- For reefs, the evidence base is twofold: (a) manufacturer reef programs targeting specific nitrate bands by reef type, and (b) coral research linking nitrate enrichment with reduced calcification/growth and higher stress/disease susceptibility under some conditions. citeturn9view0turn11search2turn11search20  
- For fish-only systems, veterinary reference ranges allow substantially higher nitrate than typical reef targets, but still recommend management when elevated. citeturn31view2  

**Corrective action (high nitrate):**
1) Validate the result and units (NO₃ vs NO₃‑N). citeturn8view1turn31view2  
2) Reduce input (feeding discipline; rinse foods; remove detritus). citeturn31view2  
3) Increase export: water changes; biological export (skimming + bacterial export, refugium, denitrification approaches). A nutrient-management program notes efficient protein skimming is essential for oxygenation and bacterial floc export during carbon dosing approaches. citeturn8view1turn31view2  
4) Apply any carbon dosing/nutrient reducers strictly per label, watching minimum nutrient thresholds to avoid starvation (some programs publish explicit minimum nitrate/phosphate levels). citeturn8view1turn8view1  

### Phosphate and silicate: nutrient control without “stripping”

**Phosphate**
- Chemistry and reef biology both support avoiding extremes: phosphate can inhibit carbonate precipitation kinetics in seawater chemistry, but nutrient starvation can also be harmful (balanced N and P support growth under some regimes). citeturn28search3turn11search20  
- A manufacturer filtration media guideline provides a practical operational target: test after 4 days and replace media if phosphate/silicate hasn’t dropped to around **0.02 mg/L**, while explicitly warning that over-treating is not recommended. citeturn29view2  

**Silicate (SiO₂)**
- A reef chemistry article reports diatom silica uptake kinetics spanning roughly **0.04–0.6 ppm SiO₂** for half-max uptake and notes some reef tanks operate under ~0.05 ppm SiO₂ detection limits. citeturn31view0  
- Practical control: treat silicate as a **source-water/process** problem (RO/DI breakthrough, new substrates) more than an in-tank “forever war.” citeturn31view0turn29view2  

### Dissolved oxygen and ORP: avoid misinterpretation

**Dissolved oxygen (DO)**
- A veterinary aquatic systems reference provides both a rule and a physical reference point: DO **>5 mg/L is optimal** for most finfish, and oxygen saturation at 25 °C is **~6.75 mg/L in seawater (35 ppt)**—meaning reefs often run only a small margin above the danger threshold if flow and gas exchange are poor. citeturn31view2  
- Immediate fixes are mechanical (aeration, flow, temperature reduction) and demand-side (stop feeding, remove decay). citeturn31view2turn15search2  

**ORP**
- ORP is a composite signal influenced by oxidizers/reducers; it is **not** a direct dissolved oxygen meter. Community/controller guidance and ozone manufacturers converge on a conservative approach: verify probes with standards and if using ozone, control within a modest band (often ~350–400 mV) and avoid sustained excessive ORP (commonly “never above ~450 mV”). citeturn10search0turn10search2turn10search14turn10search1  

### Copper, turbidity, TDS, and “hidden” system drivers

**Copper**
- Copper is essential but toxic in free form; one reef chemistry vendor (Fauna Marin knowledge base) provides explicit reference values (2–5 µg/L) and flags coral harm beginning around ~20 µg/L, with recommended measures: partial water changes, adsorbers, and source removal. citeturn31view1  
- Copper treatment for parasites belongs in quarantine; an aquaculture extension publication provides context for free copper therapeutic levels (0.15–0.20 mg/L) and emphasizes management complexity; and a chelated copper medication label specifies dosing, treatment duration, and an upper safety bound. citeturn15search0turn5view3  

**Turbidity**
- Turbidity is an optical property and can mislead chemistry interpretation; an EPA factsheet emphasizes turbidity as optical rather than direct chemical/biological measurement. A reef nutrients test kit manual warns turbidity or severe coloration can distort comparator colors. citeturn16search0turn8view1  

**TDS (RO/DI performance)**
- TDS meters estimate dissolved solids from conductivity and therefore do not detect all contaminants. This is still useful as a **trend control** for filter exhaustion and breakthrough when treated as a process metric rather than a guarantee. citeturn16search13turn16search9  

### Safe dosing limits and calculation examples

#### Manufacturer-published safety limits (foundation elements)

A published reef supplementation manual specifies maximum daily increases to reduce coral stress:
- **Calcium:** max daily +20 ppm  
- **Alkalinity:** max daily +0.5 meq/L (≈ +1.4 dKH)  
- **Magnesium:** max daily +10 ppm citeturn6view1  

Use these limits as guardrails when doing corrections in reef systems unless a product label provides a stricter bound.

#### Dose calculation examples (step-by-step)

**Example: alkalinity correction using a published stock-solution concentration**  
A manufacturer’s Foundation program manual states a KH/alkalinity stock solution where **1 mL per 100 L increases alkalinity by 0.034 dKH**. citeturn6view0turn6view1  
If your net water volume is **200 L** and you want **+1.0 dKH**:
1) Dose needed per 100 L = 1.0 / 0.034 = **29.4 mL**  
2) For 200 L: 29.4 × 2 = **58.8 mL total**  
3) Apply in divided doses (e.g., 3–6 portions over a day), staying under the program’s daily max of ~1.4 dKH total increase. citeturn6view1turn6view0  

**Example: calcium correction using the same program’s concentration**  
The same manual lists **1 mL per 100 L = 2 ppm Ca** for its prepared calcium stock. citeturn6view0turn6view1  
For **200 L** to raise calcium by **+20 ppm**:
- Required mL = (20 ppm ÷ 2 ppm per mL per 100 L) × 2 = **20 mL**  
- Respect max daily increase +20 ppm. citeturn6view1turn6view0  

**Example: magnesium correction (stock solution)**  
The same manual lists **1 mL per 100 L = 1 ppm Mg**. citeturn6view0turn6view1  
For **200 L**, raise Mg by **+30 ppm**:
- Required mL = 30 × 2 = **60 mL**  
- Compare to the program’s very conservative max daily increase of +10 ppm; that would spread this over ~3 days. citeturn6view1turn6view0  

**Example: raising potassium using a manufacturer formula**  
A potassium supplement page provides a dose formula: **m = 0.01 × v × n**, where *v* is liters and *n* is desired mg/L potassium increase. citeturn29view1  
If you have **300 L** and want **+10 mg/L K**:
- m = 0.01 × 300 × 10 = **30 mL** total (dose spread over a few days as advised). citeturn29view1  

**Example: iodine/iodide correction using a manufacturer formula**  
An iodide supplement page provides: **m = 0.125 × v × i**, where *v* is liters and *i* is desired mg/L iodide increase. citeturn29view0  
If you have **200 L** and want **+0.02 mg/L** iodide:
- m = 0.125 × 200 × 0.02 = **0.5 mL** total (dose to high flow; confirm by test/response). citeturn29view0  

**Example: nitrate correction using a manufacturer “ppm per mL” claim**  
An aquarium products manufacturer states: **1 mL per 20 gal adds 1 ppm nitrate**. citeturn23view0  
If system volume is **75 gal**, target increase **+5 ppm**:
- mL = (75/20) × 5 = **18.75 mL** total  
Practical safety approach: split dosing across multiple days and retest daily, because nitrate interacts with phosphate availability and biological uptake. citeturn23view0turn11search20  

**Example: copper dosing in quarantine (not reef display) using a medication label**  
A chelated copper medication label states: **20 drops (1 mL) per 40 L** on day 1, then repeat after 48 h to reach **0.5 mg/L** copper for saltwater, maintain for 14 days, and do not exceed **0.6 mg/L**; remove carbon/chemical filtration and invertebrates; remove copper after treatment using carbon or copper-adsorbing media. citeturn5view3
