# Angelfish Compatibility and Aggression Profile

## Executive summary

Freshwater angelfish in the genus *Pterophyllum* are best modeled as **social, hierarchy-forming cichlids whose aggression is usually “conditional” rather than constant**: they can look calm for months and then become sharply territorial when pairing and spawning, when social signaling is disrupted (notably by large water changes), or when competition and visibility are high. The strongest, best-supported drivers are (a) **pairing/spawning territory defense**, (b) **dominance hierarchy dynamics**, and (c) **predation/opportunism toward small tankmates**.citeturn10view0turn10view5turn3view0turn23view0

Compatibility decisions are therefore less about “is species X peaceful?” and more about whether a candidate tankmate:  
1) **Cannot fit in an adult angelfish’s mouth** (adult angels are opportunistic predators);  
2) **Is not a fin-nipper/boisterous stressor** (angelfish are long-finned, relatively slow, and can be persistently harassed);  
3) **Shares warm, generally soft-to-moderately hard water** that you can keep stable; and  
4) Can coexist with angelfish **turning territorial during pairing/breeding** (which may require contingency plans).citeturn23view0turn21view0turn19view0turn12view1

A practical, defensible baseline for a mixed community centered on *Pterophyllum scalare* is: **a tall 55+ gallon aquarium**, gentle-to-moderate flow, abundant vertical structure (plants/wood) to break lines of sight, and an approach to maintenance that **protects social signaling and hierarchy stability** (e.g., avoid very large single water changes when a hierarchy is established, or at least mitigate the expected post-change aggression).citeturn23view0turn8view5turn1view2turn15view0

Assumption used throughout (because you did not specify a species): **primary focus is *Pterophyllum scalare***, with explicit notes where *P. altum* and *P. leopoldi* differ.citeturn8view0turn23view0turn12view2

## Scope and assumptions

**Species scope.** The genus *Pterophyllum* comprises three widely recognized species—*P. scalare*, *P. altum*, and *P. leopoldi*—and *P. scalare* is the dominant species in both the aquarium trade and the behavior literature.citeturn8view0turn23view0turn12view1

**Domestic strain caveat.** Most aquarium “angelfish” are selectively bred *P. scalare* strains, and husbandry tolerance (especially to hardness/pH) can be broader than strict wild-habitat values, even though behavior (pairing, territoriality, dominance) remains recognizably cichlid-like.citeturn8view0turn23view0turn12view0

**Risk ratings.** “Low / Medium / High / Avoid” in the compatibility tables are **syntheses** grounded in: (a) peer-reviewed angelfish ethology and welfare literature on aggression, signaling, hierarchy, and reproductive defense; (b) reputable aquarium references (TFH, Aqueon, OATA) on predation risk, fin-nipping dynamics, and minimum housing; and (c) water-parameter overlap evidence from FishBase and care guides.citeturn6view0turn1view2turn21view0turn23view0turn15view0turn12view1

## Species scope and baseline aggression profile

### Comparing *Pterophyllum* species for compatibility planning

**Primary species: *Pterophyllum scalare*.** FishBase summarizes *P. scalare* at roughly pH 6.0–8.0, hardness ~5–13 dH, and 24–30°C, and also notes aquarium keeping “in groups of 5 or more” with a minimum aquarium length cited at 100 cm.citeturn12view0turn12view1 The 2021 welfare/behavior synthesis emphasizes that angelfish live in mixed-sex groups with hierarchies and use both restrained displays and overt fights even outside the reproductive season in captive settings.citeturn10view0turn10view2turn8view5

**Altum angelfish: *Pterophyllum altum*.** FishBase and TFH converge on *P. altum* as a much more “specialist” species: very soft, very acidic water (FishBase pH ~4.8–6.2, dH ~1–5; TFH lists pH ~4.2–6.2) and warm temperatures (FishBase 27–31°C; TFH advises keeping above ~28°C). TFH also explicitly describes *P. altum* as having “no tolerance for dissolved wastes” and needing a very large, high aquarium with substantial cover.citeturn12view2turn13view3 For compatibility, this pushes you toward a highly constrained “soft/acidic/warm/ultra-clean” community and very careful tankmate selection.citeturn13view3turn12view2

**Leopold’s angelfish: *Pterophyllum leopoldi*.** High-quality husbandry information is thinner and sometimes inconsistent across sources; FishBase’s maximum length listing appears unusually small, so treat size claims cautiously and prioritize species-verified sources when possible.citeturn12view4 Aqueon characterizes *P. leopoldi* as the smallest and “most aggressive” of the three, and notes it is rarely seen in the hobby.citeturn23view0 If you are actually keeping *P. leopoldi* (not a mis-ID), you should bias toward **more space** and **more structured sight breaks**, and assume **higher intraspecific aggression risk**.citeturn23view0turn8view1

### Baseline aggression repertoire and what it looks like

Peer-reviewed synthesis work on angelfish welfare describes a spectrum from **restrained displays** (frontal display, lateral threat, undulation) to **overt fights** (mouth fighting, nipping, chasing). These behaviors are fundamental to how angelfish form and maintain hierarchy and territory.citeturn10view2turn10view0

Two practical implications follow directly:

- Aggression is often **ritualized** at first; if tanks are too small or too open, ritualized conflict can escalate into repeated contact aggression (biting, mouth fighting) with injury risk.citeturn10view2turn15view0turn23view0  
- Anything that increases encounter rates (visibility, crowding, high activity) or destabilizes signaling can raise the frequency and intensity of aggression.citeturn8view1turn10view1turn1view2

## Life stages, sex, and breeding status

### Juveniles versus adults

**Juveniles (compatibility window is usually widest).** Juvenile angelfish still establish dominance relationships and show aggressive interactions in aquaria, but predation risk to tankmates is typically lower simply because gape size is smaller.citeturn10view0turn10view2 However, the welfare review highlights that social rank already affects feeding readiness and intake—subordinates may hang back and eat less—so “peaceful-looking” juvenile groups can still contain meaningful chronic stress if space/structure is inadequate.citeturn10view3turn5search16

**Adults (compatibility narrows, especially after pairing).** Aqueon explicitly notes that angelfish may be generally peaceful but will eat smaller fish opportunistically, and that aggression often increases when they attempt to pair off and spawn.citeturn23view0 The scientific synthesis similarly describes the transition into **territorial defense during the reproductive season**, with ongoing hierarchy dynamics in captive systems even outside breeding.citeturn10view0turn10view5

### Sex differences and sexing reliability

Angelfish are often described as **sexually monomorphic** (hard to sex visually), and the welfare review states this explicitly for *P. scalare*.citeturn8view0 OATA likewise warns that sexing varies by species and may show no differences unless fish are breeding.citeturn15view0 Practical sexing therefore tends to be most reliable **during spawning**, when breeding tubes/genital papilla are clear (also described in detailed hobby guidance).citeturn19view0turn23view0

### Paired/breeding versus solitary/group

**Pair bonding with active defense is a central aggression amplifier.** FishBase explicitly notes that during the brooding cycle, pair bonding is maintained “complete with defence of each partner against aggression or potential rivals.”citeturn12view1

Peer-reviewed work on angelfish mating dynamics supports the practical observation that **the presence of a mate increases aggression**, and that male aggressiveness is a key variable in mating contexts.citeturn3view0turn3view1

A welfare/behavior synthesis of classic brood-care sources reports that once a reproductive pair is established, eggs are laid on a cleaned substrate (often hundreds per spawn) and biparental care includes defense, ventilation, and cleaning. It also states that each parent tends to be more aggressive to same-sex intruders during brood defense.citeturn9view3turn10view5

Practical takeaway: **“Compatible tankmates” often become “targets” when an angelfish pair spawns**, particularly in modestly sized community tanks. Your compatibility plan must include a breeding contingency (divider, removal, or a dedicated breeding tank).citeturn23view0turn15view0turn12view1

## Environmental and husbandry levers that shift aggression and compatibility

### Tank size and stocking density effects

Multiple reputable sources converge on “more space, more height” as the single most reliable aggression-reducer for angelfish communities:

- Aqueon recommends **55 gallons or larger** for full-grown angelfish, explicitly noting that tall aquariums are best and that décor should include vertical driftwood and broad-leaf plants.citeturn23view0  
- FishBase cites aquarium keeping in groups of 5+ and a minimum cited aquarium length of 100 cm in its compilation, reinforcing that angelfish are not a “small-tank centerpiece” when kept as a true social group.citeturn12view0turn12view1  
- OATA provides a group-stocking heuristic for shoaling species such as angelfish: **allow ~40 liters per adult fish**, and emphasizes the need for sufficient tank height.citeturn15view0

A scientifically grounded welfare review also summarizes work indicating that as group size increases, angelfish show a greater propensity to shoal but may also show marginal increases in aggressive interactions plausibly linked to territory defense and social position maintenance—meaning “bigger groups” are not a substitute for “enough space and structure.”citeturn8view1turn6view3

### Tank layout, cover, and planting

The welfare review frames “physical enrichment” (plants, roots, logs, background changes) as a means to **provide shelters and reduce contact probability** among territorial fish.citeturn8view3turn8view5 Aqueon and JBL independently converge on very similar layout recommendations for angelfish: broadleaf plants, vertically arranged wood/roots, shaded areas, and sight breaks.citeturn23view0turn19view0

Two layout elements have special relevance because they directly connect to aggression triggers:

- **Vertical/flat spawning substrates (large leaves, slate, cones)**: pairs will guard these sites and will chase other fish away during spawning.citeturn23view0turn10view5turn19view0  
- **Line-of-sight breaks**: when fish can “disappear” from one another, you reduce repeated encounters that escalate into chasing and nipping.citeturn19view0turn8view5

### Water parameters and how they interact with aggression

**Core *P. scalare* ranges.** FishBase lists *P. scalare* at pH 6–8, ~5–13 dH, and 24–30°C.citeturn12view1 Aqueon’s captive-raised guidance centers around pH ~6.8–7.8, 78–84°F, and moderate hardness (as carbonate hardness), emphasizing that captive fish accept a wide range but prefer warmer conditions.citeturn23view0

**Abiotic factors can modulate aggression intensity.** The welfare review reports that higher luminosity can increase specific aggressive behaviors in angelfish (more frontal display and mouth fighting at higher light levels), and it also explains a plausible pathway for temperature: lower temperatures reduce swimming activity, producing fewer encounters and therefore less aggression.citeturn10view1turn9view7

You generally should not “tune temperature down” as an aggression-management strategy if it compromises the fish; instead, treat it as an explanation for why some tanks become more conflict-prone during warmer/brighter conditions.citeturn10view1turn23view0

### Diet and feeding frequency

Angelfish are described in the welfare review as **omnivorous in broad terms**, feeding across algae, insects, microcrustaceans, and worms, and their feeding preferences change as they develop.citeturn10view5turn10view6 Aqueon recommends feeding only what they consume in ~2–3 minutes, once or twice daily, and rotating foods; OATA similarly emphasizes avoiding overfeeding and recommends feeding what fish consume in a few minutes (with a general “once a day” cadence for American cichlids).citeturn23view0turn15view0

From an aggression standpoint, the most defensible feeding-related mechanism in the peer-reviewed angelfish literature is **rank-skew in feeding access**: subordinate fish may be less ready to feed and consume fewer items than dominants in group settings.citeturn10view3turn5search16 This makes “single-point feeding” a risk factor for chronic suppression even when overt fights are rare.

### Social hierarchy, chemical communication, and “maintenance shocks”

Two unusually practical findings emerge from the angelfish welfare synthesis:

- **Social isolation is not a clean solution to aggression risk.** Isolation can impair normal behavior and feeding, and the review notes that aggressive interaction does not necessarily increase after isolation in juvenile *P. scalare*, even though other welfare-relevant behaviors degrade.citeturn10view4turn4view2  
- **Large water renewals can destabilize social signaling.** The welfare review explicitly states that changes impairing social signals can increase aggressive interactions, and it includes a best-practice guidance to avoid renewing more than ~25% of tank water at once because it may disturb established hierarchies and increase fights.citeturn8view5turn8view3

The underlying experimental work on juvenile angelfish supports the mechanism: water renewal can dilute chemical cues and increase aggressive interaction frequency over hours following the change.citeturn1view2

## Compatibility matrix for common community fish

The table below is written for **mixed-species, *P. scalare*-centered community tanks** unless otherwise noted. For *P. altum*, apply stricter water/cleanliness requirements and assume many community options become impractical.citeturn13view3turn12view2

**Interpretation note.** “Recommended minimum tank size” refers to **a reasonable minimum for the combined setup** (angelfish + that tankmate group) that is consistent with major care guidance emphasizing tall 55+ gallon housing for adult angelfish communities and OATA’s per-adult stocking guidance.citeturn23view0turn15view0

| Tankmate category (common examples) | Aggression risk with juvenile angelfish | Aggression risk with adult angelfish | Recommended minimum tank size | Recommended group sizes | Mitigation strategies that actually move the needle |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Peaceful, mid-sized **tetras** (e.g., “larger tetras”) | Low–Medium | Medium | 55+ gal (tall) | 8+ is a common schooling baseline (size-dependent) | Choose tetras large enough not to be eaten; keep them truly schooled (dilution); add tall plants/wood to break sight lines; feed in multiple locations to prevent rank-based food suppression.citeturn23view0turn10view3turn8view5 |
| **Very small tetras** (e.g., ember-sized; very small juveniles of other species) | Medium | High / Avoid | 55+ gal doesn’t “fix” prey-size | 10+ if kept at all (to reduce stress), but size remains the constraint | Core issue is predation: small fish tend to become food as angels mature; mitigation is “don’t use prey-sized fish,” not “more plants.”citeturn19view0turn23view0 |
| **Fin-nipping tetras/characins** (e.g., red minor/serpae-type; black-skirt-type reputations) | Medium | High / Avoid | 55–75 gal (still risky) | If attempted despite risk: large group to diffuse nipping + constant monitoring | Fin nippers target long fins; once established, chronic fin damage drives stress/infection risk. Prefer non-nipping schooling species instead.citeturn19view0turn23view0turn10view2 |
| **Barbs: tiger barb–type** | High / Avoid | Avoid | 75+ gal if attempted (risk remains) | 8–12+ (large schools reduce interspecific harassment) | Tiger barbs establish hierarchy by nipping/chasing; when mixed with long-finned fish, “playful nipping” becomes harassment. Large schools + lots of space reduce but do not eliminate the risk.citeturn21view0 |
| **Barbs: “peaceful barbs”** | Medium | Medium | 55+ gal | Species-dependent; if schooling, keep a proper school | Only consider barbs explicitly described as peaceful in reputable care guidance; avoid mixing angelfish with boisterous, fin-directed barbs.citeturn23view0turn21view0 |
| Peaceful **gouramis** | Low–Medium | Medium | 55+ gal | Typically 1–2 centerpiece fish (species-dependent) | Watch for mutual intimidation or territorial overlap in mid/upper layers; build shaded zones and plant cover; avoid pairing gouramis with a breeding angelfish pair in limited space.citeturn23view0turn19view0turn10view5 |
| **Discus** | Medium (parameter-sensitive) | Medium | 75–100+ gal | Discus are typically kept in groups; angels may be multiple | Works best at higher temperatures (Aqueon notes >82°F); the challenge is not just temperament but keeping both species in stable warm water with enough space, while managing angelfish pairing aggression.citeturn23view0turn10view5turn12view1 |
| **Dwarf cichlids** (e.g., *Apistogramma* spp.) | Medium | Medium | 55+ gal | Often 1 male + multiple females (species-dependent) | Provide bottom territories and visual barriers; avoid “single cave = single hotspot”; if angelfish spawn, expect cross-tank tension and have a separation plan.citeturn19view0turn8view5turn10view5 |
| **More aggressive American cichlids** | High / Avoid | Avoid | 75+ gal (but mismatch persists) | — | OATA explicitly separates calmer species like angelfish from “more aggressive species” that often must be kept alone or only with similarly aggressive cichlids; mixed aggression styles can produce persistent conflict.citeturn15view0turn23view0 |
| **Armored catfish** (e.g., Corydoras; other medium catfish) | Low | Low–Medium | 55+ gal | For schooling catfish, keep an actual group | Bottom-zone separation reduces direct conflict; ensure substrate is compatible (smooth/fine) and provide multiple feeding spots so subordinates still get food.citeturn23view0turn15view0 |
| **Plecos** (esp. smaller/medium “community plecos”) | Low–Medium | Medium | 55+ gal | Often 1 per tank (species-dependent) | Provide wood/caves and ensure pleco is fed (avoid nocturnal “resource conflict” around a single cave); watch for spawning angelfish defending vertical surfaces.citeturn23view0turn19view0turn10view5 |
| **Rasboras** (larger types) | Low–Medium | Medium | 55+ gal | 8+ common schooling baseline | Works when rasboras are large enough and not hyperactive; keep gentle flow and shaded cover. Aqueon lists rasboras among suitable tankmates because they match “peaceful community” behavior better than fin nippers.citeturn23view0turn19view0 |
| **Danios** (zebra/giant danio groups) | Medium | Medium–High | 55+ gal (often not ideal pairing) | 6+ (Aqueon) | Danios are boisterous schooling fish; they thrive with cooler temps (~70–78°F) and strong current, while angelfish prefer warmer, gentler flow. Even if fights are rare, constant motion can stress angelfish and intensify encounter rates.citeturn23view1turn23view0turn22search4turn10view1 |
| **Livebearers** (guppies, platies, mollies) | Medium | Medium–High | 55+ gal | Many are kept in groups/colonies | Primary issue is water mismatch: mollies are documented in harder, more alkaline water (e.g., pH ~7.5–8.2; high dH), platies trend alkaline and cooler (FishBase), while angelfish are centered on warmer and often softer conditions. If you tune water for livebearers, angelfish may be stressed long-term (and vice versa).citeturn22search10turn22search3turn12view1turn23view0 |
| **Shrimp** | High | Avoid (except possibly large, well-sheltered individuals) | Any | Group size doesn’t fix predation | JBL explicitly notes snails are problem-free but shrimp (except some large species) are unlikely to “stand a chance,” and even large shrimp may hide rather than roam. Expect predation or chronic hiding.citeturn19view0turn23view0 |
| **Snails** | Low | Low | Any (parameter-compatible) | — | JBL describes snails as “completely problem-free” in angelfish contexts; still ensure water parameters are compatible for the snail species you choose.citeturn19view0 |

### Juvenile-to-adult compatibility shifts you should plan for

Even when early stocking “works,” several transitions commonly flip compatibility:

- **Growth → predation threshold:** as angelfish mouth size increases, “small-but-fast” fish can still become “food-sized.” This is why compatibility must be judged against the adult angelfish, not the juvenile.citeturn23view0turn19view0  
- **Pair formation → territory claim:** pairing/spawning can make previously ignored midwater fish into “intruders,” especially around the defended spawning surface and its surrounding territory.citeturn23view0turn10view5turn12view1  
- **Stability shocks → hierarchy re-establishment fights:** major water changes and other signal-disrupting events can elevate aggressive interactions for hours (or longer) as social signaling re-stabilizes.citeturn1view2turn8view5turn10view1

## Practical husbandry recommendations to reduce aggression

### Setup principles that reduce aggression without compromising welfare

A defensible “aggression-minimizing” angelfish system usually looks like this:

- **Space + height first.** Aqueon recommends 55+ gallons for adult angelfish and explicitly notes tall tanks and gentle flow; OATA provides the complementary stocking heuristic of ~40 L per adult angelfish for shoaling setups.citeturn23view0turn15view0  
- **Structure the tank vertically and visually.** Use broadleaf plants, vertically oriented driftwood/roots, and some floating cover to create shaded zones and line-of-sight breaks.citeturn23view0turn19view0turn8view5  
- **Assume pairing will happen unless you actively prevent it.** If you keep multiple angelfish, pairing is a normal outcome; once a pair defends a spawning site, expect “whole-tank” behavior changes in modest tanks.citeturn23view0turn12view1turn10view5

### Management practices that reduce “avoidable” aggression spikes

**Water change strategy.** OATA’s general recommendation for American cichlids is ~25% weekly, but angelfish-specific welfare synthesis highlights that renewing more than ~25% at once can disturb established hierarchies and increase fights, consistent with experimental work showing increased aggression after water renewal due to signal dilution. Practically, favor **smaller, more frequent changes** in stable, socially settled angelfish groups, and if you must do a large emergency change, expect and mitigate the temporary aggression spike (dim lights, add temporary visual barriers, feed lightly after).citeturn15view0turn8view5turn1view2turn10view1

**Lighting and temperature.** Avoid abrupt shifts. Higher luminosity can increase specific aggressive behaviors (including costly mouth fighting) in angelfish, and temperature affects activity and encounter rates. Use stable photoperiods and avoid “sudden bright tank with nowhere to hide.”citeturn10view1turn23view0turn19view0

**Feeding to reduce rank-skew.** Because subordinates can be less ready to feed and consume fewer items in group contexts, reduce conflict by splitting food across multiple zones (“broadcast” feeding) and keeping meals predictable. Aqueon’s “2–3 minute rule” and OATA’s “few minutes” guidance both support limiting uneaten food while still allowing adequate access.citeturn5search16turn23view0turn15view0

### Interventions when aggression becomes damaging

When you see persistent chasing, mouth fighting, shredded fins, or a fish that hides and stops feeding, treat it as a **system problem**, not just “one mean fish.” The angelfish welfare synthesis explicitly treats increased aggression and lack of normal feeding/reproductive behavior as meaningful welfare signals.citeturn8view5turn10view2turn23view0

The most reliably effective interventions (from the literature-backed mechanisms above) are:

- **Add or reconfigure sight breaks** (plants/wood/temporary dividers), especially if one fish or a pair is visually dominating open water.citeturn8view5turn23view0turn19view0  
- **Reduce the conflict surface area around spawning sites** (remove the defended slate/leaf if you do not want breeding behavior in the community; or move the pair).citeturn23view0turn10view5  
- **Decrease crowding / rehome excess angelfish** if a pair begins to claim most of the tank—this is explicitly anticipated in detailed husbandry guidance for groups that later form pairs.citeturn19view0turn23view0turn12view0  
- **Avoid “social isolation as a fix” unless you have no alternative.** Isolation can suppress aggression injuries but can also degrade behavior and feeding; welfare synthesis explicitly treats social enrichment as important for angelfish.citeturn10view4turn8view3turn8view5
