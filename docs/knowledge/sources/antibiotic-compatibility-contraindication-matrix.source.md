# Antibiotic Compatibility and Contraindications Matrix for Adult Systemic Therapy

## Executive summary

“Antibiotic compatibility” in practice spans three distinct risk domains that are often conflated: (a) **systemic drug–drug interactions** that change exposure or add toxicity (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic), (b) **IV co-administration incompatibility** (physical precipitation or chemical degradation when drugs contact each other in a bag/syringe/Y-site/line), and (c) **intentional combination therapy** (synergy) that may be desirable clinically but still requires line-management and toxicity monitoring. Because IV compatibility is highly dependent on **concentration, diluent, temperature, and contact time**, compatibility findings can vary across studies and references; the safest operational assumption is to **avoid contact unless compatibility for the exact conditions is verified**. citeturn6search5turn7search2turn6search15

Across commonly used adult systemic antibiotics, the **highest-impact, evidence-supported “do-not-mix / do-not-co-infuse” scenarios** are:  
• **Aminoglycosides + many beta-lactams** in the same solution/line segment (chemical inactivation); explicitly flagged across multiple labels, with particular clinical relevance in severe renal impairment and in drug-level sampling artifacts. citeturn13search3turn7search0turn7search36  
• **Vancomycin + beta-lactams** (precipitation/physical incompatibility risk; risk increases with higher vancomycin concentration); labeling generally recommends separating/flush between administrations. citeturn7search2turn6search11  
• **Ceftriaxone + IV calcium-containing solutions**: contraindicated in neonates receiving IV calcium; for non-neonates, sequential administration may be allowed with thorough line flushing (per labeling). citeturn9search4turn9search12turn9search0  
• **Daptomycin + dextrose-containing diluents** (incompatible per labeling). citeturn9search3  

For **systemic co-prescribing**, the most clinically consequential antibiotic–antibiotic interactions are concentrated in a few patterns:  
• **Rifampin (and some rifamycin regimens)** lowering exposures of key companion antibiotics (notably **linezolid, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX**, and **clarithromycin**), creating risk for under-treatment when those agents are backbone therapy. citeturn4search7turn4search8turn2search2turn17search1turn4search2  
• **Additive nephrotoxicity** with combined nephrotoxic antibiotics—especially **vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam** (consistently associated with higher AKI risk in meta-analyses) and **vancomycin + aminoglycosides** (toxicity concerns emphasized in endocarditis guidance). citeturn1search18turn1search22turn15view0  
• **Additive QT-prolongation risk** when **macrolides** and **fluoroquinolones** are used together, particularly in patients with baseline risk factors (electrolyte disturbances, structural heart disease, advanced age). citeturn3search12turn3search10turn8search2turn3search1

## Scope and methods

**Scope.** This report covers **systemic antibiotics commonly used in adults** (IV and oral when relevant) across major classes the request specified (beta-lactams including carbapenems/monobactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, sulfonamides, lincosamides, polymyxins, nitroimidazoles, fosfomycin, daptomycin, rifamycins, and select others). “Systemic” excludes topical-only and most inhaled-only agents, except when an agent’s labeling provides systemic interaction or safety-critical compatibility constraints.

**What “comprehensive” means here.** A literal all-by-all pairwise matrix across all systemic antibiotics would be thousands of pairs, the vast majority of which are **“no known clinically meaningful interaction”** and/or **“compatibility not studied for your exact concentrations/diluents.”** Instead, this report is comprehensive in the clinically relevant sense: it captures (1) labeled contraindications/incompatibilities, (2) high-severity or high-frequency interaction patterns supported by primary studies/meta-analyses/guidelines, and (3) common high-risk co-administration scenarios in acute care. The matrix explicitly flags where evidence is **condition-dependent** or **conflicting**, which is common in IV compatibility science. citeturn6search5turn6search15turn6search11  

**Evidence hierarchy used.**  
• **Level 1 (Highest):** Regulatory prescribing information / product monographs; major society consensus guidelines. citeturn7search2turn4search7turn16search4turn15view0  
• **Level 2:** Systematic reviews/meta-analyses or RCTs with clinical outcomes. citeturn1search18turn5search8  
• **Level 3:** Human pharmacokinetic studies and PK/PD target-attainment analyses. citeturn17search1turn4search8turn2search2turn4search0  
• **Level 4:** Controlled in vitro compatibility / time-kill / pharmacodynamic models; case reports (used for uncertainty/gaps, not as sole basis for absolute rules). citeturn6search15turn12search24turn13search1  

**Severity scale in the matrix.**  
• **Contraindicated / Do not coadminister** (often population- or route-specific)  
• **Major (Avoid if possible)** – credible risk of treatment failure or serious toxicity  
• **Moderate (Use with monitoring/adjustments)** – clinically relevant in selected contexts  
• **Operational constraint** – therapy may be appropriate, but IV co-infusion is unsafe or unverified  
• **Uncertain / condition-dependent** – evidence varies by concentration, regimen, or population

## Practical clinical recommendations and monitoring

**Operational rule for IV co-administration:** If two antibiotics must share a catheter, avoid “trial-and-error.” Confirm compatibility for the **exact concentrations, diluents, and contact time** (Y-site vs admixture vs syringe), because “compatible” can flip to “incompatible” with different concentrations. citeturn6search5turn6search15turn7search2 When compatibility is unverified or conflicting, default to: **separate lumen/line** → if unavailable, **sequential administration with adequate flushing** → if neither feasible, reassess regimen/line strategy. citeturn7search2turn0search16  

**Renal-toxicity risk management for nephrotoxic combinations:**  
Vancomycin-, aminoglycoside-, and polymyxin-associated AKI risk increases with patient factors and concomitant nephrotoxins; combinations such as vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam show higher AKI incidence in multiple analyses. citeturn1search18turn5search8turn5search2 In practice, the best-supported mitigation is to (1) minimize overlap duration, (2) avoid additional nephrotoxins when possible, and (3) implement **robust TDM** where available (vancomycin AUC; aminoglycoside levels) to avoid excessive exposure. citeturn16search4turn16search2turn16search25  

**Vancomycin monitoring:** For serious MRSA infections, consensus guidance recommends targeting an AUC/MIC of **400–600** (assuming MIC 1 mg/L) to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk. citeturn16search4turn16search0 Meta-analyses comparing AUC-guided vs trough-only monitoring show lower nephrotoxicity risk with AUC-guided strategies. citeturn16search25turn16search5  

**Aminoglycoside monitoring:** Aminoglycosides require TDM when therapy extends beyond short courses; institutional protocols commonly use peak/trough targets (or AUC-based approaches) to reduce accumulation and toxicity while preserving efficacy. citeturn16search2turn16search10turn16search14 Clinically, this becomes non-negotiable when aminoglycosides are paired with other nephrotoxic antibiotics or in renal dysfunction. citeturn13search27turn15view0  

**QT-risk combinations:** When a macrolide and a fluoroquinolone are combined, the mechanism is primarily additive QT prolongation risk; product labeling and safety communications emphasize heightened risk in predisposed patients. citeturn3search12turn3search10turn8search2 Operationally, manage by correcting electrolytes, limiting other QT-prolongers, and obtaining ECG monitoring for high-risk patients rather than universal screening. citeturn3search7turn8search2  

**Rifamycin-driven underexposure risk:** Rifampin reduces exposures of linezolid, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, and TMP-SMX in human PK studies, and reduces clarithromycin exposure in mycobacterial therapy contexts; these interactions can matter most when the affected drug is a regimen “backbone.” citeturn4search7turn4search8turn2search2turn17search1turn4search33 When coadministration is unavoidable, the most evidence-aligned approach is close clinical monitoring (and TDM where feasible), rather than assuming standard doses remain effective. citeturn1search27turn4search0  

## IV compatibility workflows and administration timing

A pragmatic decision flow for antibiotic IV compatibility is below. It intentionally defaults to safety when evidence is missing or condition-dependent, consistent with compatibility reference guidance that absence of visible precipitation does not guarantee chemical stability. citeturn6search5

A timing example for sequential administration (when Y-site is incompatible or unverified) is shown below. Specific flush volumes and infusion durations must follow local policy and each product’s infusion instructions; the key safety principle is eliminating unverified contact time in the shared line.

## Evidence gaps and primary-source reference roadmap

**Gaps and uncertainties that materially affect decision-making:**

1) **Concentration/diluent specificity is the rule, not the exception,** for IV compatibility. Even for iconic pairs (e.g., vancomycin + beta-lactams), labeling gives a precautionary general statement, while individual studies and systematic reviews show compatibility may vary by concentrations and vehicles. citeturn7search2turn6search11turn6search35  

2) **“No visible precipitate” does not guarantee chemical stability.** Compatibility references emphasize that physical appearance alone can miss chemical degradation, which is particularly relevant for beta-lactam–aminoglycoside inactivation and other time-dependent reactions. citeturn6search5turn7search36  

3) **Rifamycin interactions are regimen- and population-dependent.** Human PK studies show meaningful reductions for multiple antibiotics, but translation into clinical failure varies by organism, site of infection, dosing, and whether the companion drug is essential vs redundant. citeturn4search0turn17search1turn4search21  

4) **Some interaction signals are strong but causal mechanisms remain debated.** The vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam AKI signal is consistent across many observational datasets and meta-analyses, but debates persist about contributions from creatinine handling vs true injury across subpopulations, reinforcing the need for conservative monitoring and alternative beta-lactams when feasible. citeturn1search18turn6search7turn5search34

- **Dedicated IV compatibility compendia and databases** (critical for line-management because primary studies are fragmented):

**High-priority additions if you want to expand the matrix further (most cost-effective research targets):** (1) drug-specific Y-site compatibility for ICU “workhorse” antibiotics at typical concentrations (vancomycin continuous infusion, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole), (2) rifamycin interactions with additional antibiotics used in NTM regimens (e.g., clofazimine, bedaquiline—if in scope), (3) special-population contraindications that change combination choices (e.g., neonatal ceftriaxone constraints; pregnancy restrictions; severe hepatic impairment with macrolides/rifamycins), and (4) reconciliation tables when compendia disagree, documenting conditions that explain discordance (concentration, vehicle, study duration, container material). citeturn6search5turn6search35turn9search12turn14search22
