# Pool Algae Outbreak Playbook for Green, Mustard, and Black Algae

## Executive summary

Pool “algae outbreaks” are best managed as a **process-control failure** (sanitizer, pH, circulation, filtration, bather load, and biofilm management), not merely a cosmetic nuisance. The **fastest durable recoveries** come from a combined approach: (1) restore effective disinfectant chemistry (especially chlorine speciation and stabilizer balance), (2) physically break and remove attached growth and biofilms, (3) filter aggressively to clear dead biomass, and (4) correct the underlying cause that allowed growth to start. citeturn38view0turn41view0turn64view2turn66view2

**Green algae** is typically a water-column or lightly attached bloom that responds quickly to sustained free-chlorine exposure plus brushing/vacuuming and continuous filtration. **Mustard (yellow) algae** in pool-operator practice is an **easily brushed “dust-like” yellow film** that recurs and often thrives in shaded/low-circulation areas; it may involve “yellow-green” algae taxa (xanthophytes) and/or mixed communities, so color alone is not definitive. citeturn17search1turn26search1turn17search10

**Black algae** is most often a **biofilm dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria** and is substantially more persistent because it behaves like a protected, anchored biofilm community; treatment must prioritize **mechanical disruption** (aggressive brushing/spot treatment) alongside sustained disinfectant residuals and, in some cases, targeted algaecides (notably certain copper/silver approaches), with escalation to surface remediation if entrenched. citeturn25view0turn16search0

Algaecides can be useful but should be framed as **adjuncts**: the entity["organization","World Health Organization","un agency"] notes that algal growth is fundamentally nutrient- and hydraulics-dependent and that in properly managed pools, routine reliance on algicides should not be necessary; filtration/coagulation and good hydraulic design are central controls. citeturn41view0turn38view0

## Biology and identification

### What “pool algae” commonly includes

“Algae” in pools can include **true algae** (eukaryotic microalgae such as chlorophytes/green algae and xanthophytes/yellow-green algae) and **cyanobacteria** (photosynthetic bacteria) embedded within biofilms. A classic survey of swimming pool algae found multiple genera across cyanophytes, chlorophytes, and chrysophytes/yellow-green groups—supporting that pools often contain a **mixed algal community** and that appearance alone can mislead. citeturn17search1turn17search10

### Visual cues (field identification)

**Green algae (typical “green pool” / green film)**
- **Water color shift** (haze → green tint → opaque green) and/or **slick green film** on walls/steps.
- Often appears after **low free chlorine**, heavy rain/dust, debris load, or filtration downtime; responds well to brushing and sustained chlorination. citeturn64view2turn38view0turn41view0

**Mustard/yellow algae (operator category)**
- Yellow-to-mustard “dust” or thin film that **brushes off easily** but returns quickly; frequently seen in **shaded** or low-circulation zones (under ladders, behind lights, along steps/benches).
- Because pool samples often contain mixed algae, treat “mustard” as a **behavioral/operational phenotype** (dusty, recurring, shade-associated) rather than a guaranteed taxonomy. citeturn17search10turn41view0turn38view0

**Black algae**
- Dark blue-green to black **spots/nodules** on plaster/grout/rough surfaces; often feels **slimy** then re-hardens.
- Strongly associated with **biofilm behavior** and protected growth inside surface irregularities; typically requires aggressive mechanical disruption and sustained treatment. citeturn25view0turn38view0

### Microscopy cues (confirmatory, not required for most operators)

Microscopy is most useful when (a) outbreaks repeatedly recur despite correct chemistry, (b) discoloration may be stains/soil, or (c) black “algae” is suspected and you want to confirm cyanobacterial filaments/biofilm features.

**Sampling**
- For attached growth: scrape a small area into sterile water; mount a wet prep.
- For water-column blooms: collect turbid water, allow light settling, examine the concentrate.

**Green algae—typical features**
- Many green microalgae are small (often a few micrometers) and show green chloroplast-containing cells; *Chlorella* species are commonly described as small, ovoid-to-spherical, 2–10 µm cells. citeturn16search1turn17search3

**Mustard/yellow algae—likely contributors**
- Yellow-green algae (xanthophytes) lack chlorophyll b and instead include chlorophyll a/c plus carotenoids, contributing to a yellowish-green hue; a pool-algae survey identified *Pleurochloris pyrenoidosa* (a yellow-green/xanthophyte) as highly prevalent in sampled pools, supporting a plausible biological basis for “yellow/mustard” appearance in some cases. citeturn26search1turn17search1

**Black algae—key features**
- Filamentous cyanobacteria form chains (trichomes), sometimes within a mucous sheath, consistent with biofilm-forming morphology. citeturn16search0turn25view0  
- A recent open-access study found black algae biofilms in pools were dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria (order Leptolyngbyales) and highlighted biofilm traits (e.g., extracellular polysaccharide production) supporting chemical resistance and persistence. citeturn25view0turn16search0

### Growth conditions and enabling factors

Across algae types, outbreaks are enabled by:
- **Insufficient disinfectant residual** and/or reduced disinfectant effectiveness from poor pH control and stabilizer imbalance. citeturn64view2turn38view1turn37view3turn40view0
- **Particles/turbidity** that compromise disinfection (microbes can be shielded by particulates) and reduce clarity; filtration is a core safety and disinfection support layer. citeturn38view0turn38view2
- **Nutrients**, especially phosphate/nitrogen/potassium. WHO notes algal growth requires these nutrients and that phosphate can be reduced via coagulation/filtration; however, best control is usually achieved through effective treatment and hydraulic design rather than routine algicide dependence. citeturn41view0turn38view3
- **Biofilm reservoirs** (especially black algae): biofilms can resist disinfectants and may shelter other microbes; black algae biofilms have been flagged as potential reservoirs for pathogenic bacteria even when the cyanobacteria themselves are non-toxic. citeturn25view0turn38view0

## Rapid diagnostics

### Stepwise “is it algae?” triage

**Step one: verify water/scenario basics**
- Measure **free chlorine (FC), total chlorine (TC), combined chlorine (CC = TC − FC), pH**, and (if outdoor or stabilized programs) **cyanuric acid (CYA)**. citeturn64view1turn40view0turn37view3  
- In public-pool operations, maintaining minimum disinfectant residuals and pH in range is a baseline control expectation. citeturn64view2turn40view0turn39view1

**Step two: brush test**
- Brush a 1–2 ft² patch. If it clouds into a green/yellow plume, that strongly suggests biological growth (or very fine dust) rather than a fixed stain. (This is operational practice; confirm with chemistry response below.) citeturn56view1turn43view0

**Step three: “chlorine demand response”**
- If FC is repeatedly falling faster than expected despite dosing, you likely have a high oxidant demand from organics, active bloom, or biofilm load; this pattern supports an algae/biofilm hypothesis. citeturn38view2turn64view1turn66view2

**Step four: location pattern**
- Mustard phenotype tends to recur in shade/low flow zones. Black algae often localizes to rough/porous surfaces and cracks where biofilm anchoring is favored. citeturn25view0turn38view0

### Rapid “false positive” exclusions

**Soil/pollen/dust**
- Often collects uniformly on the floor and returns quickly but does *not* drive high chlorine demand; a thorough vacuum to waste plus improved skimming and filtration can resolve it. Filtration performance and backwashing criteria matter. citeturn38view3turn38view0

**Metal staining (iron/copper/manganese)**
- Stains do not brush into a plume and typically do not increase chlorine demand. Before using copper-based products, some labels explicitly instruct testing for metals due to staining risk. citeturn43view1turn62view1

## Treatment protocols

### Core principles (apply to all algae types)

1. **Close/limit use as needed**  
   - Follow local code and safety rules; disinfectant levels above normal operating ranges and poor clarity should trigger restrictions. Wisconsin water-quality standards include closure triggers tied to disinfectant and pH limits; MAHC-derived inspection materials treat clarity and disinfectant levels as critical. citeturn40view0turn39view1turn39view0

2. **Restore effective chlorination conditions first**  
   - Maintain pH in the recommended band (commonly ~7.2–7.8 in multiple public-health/operator references) because chlorine speciation and effectiveness depend strongly on pH. citeturn40view0turn38view1turn64view2turn64view3  
   - Monitor stabilizer (CYA). WHO notes high cyanurate can reduce effective free chlorine and argues CYA should be monitored and kept below ~100 mg/L; the “chlorine lock” concept is described at very high CYA levels. citeturn37view3turn38view1turn66view0

3. **Physical removal is not optional**  
   - Brushing breaks boundary layers/biofilm matrix and exposes organisms to disinfectant; vacuuming removes settled debris so it cannot reseed or consume chlorine. Polymeric-algaecide labels commonly instruct vacuuming after ~24 hours to remove debris. citeturn45view1turn43view0turn38view0

4. **Run circulation and filtration continuously during kill-and-clear**  
   - WHO emphasizes filtration and hydraulics for disinfection support and recommends backwashing based on pressure differential/time/turbidity; ensure 24-hour operation during interventions. citeturn38view3turn38view2turn38view0

### Shock dosing and chemical calculations

#### Pool volume formulas (when unknown)

Use measured dimensions (ft) with label-supported rules of thumb:
- Rectangular: **Gallons = L × W × Avg Depth × 7.5** citeturn54view1  
- Circular/elliptical: **Gallons = L × W × Avg Depth × 5.9** citeturn54view1

#### Chlorine dosing: general formula

To raise free chlorine by Δppm using a liquid bleach/chlorine solution, use:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} \approx \frac{\Delta \text{ppm} \times \text{Pool gallons}}{(\%\ \text{available chlorine}) \times 10{,}000}
\]

This is a practical field approximation that aligns with typical pool-operator dosing logic; disinfectant availability and stabilizer chemistry are treated as key control factors in WHO and EPA/ANSI-linked literature. citeturn38view1turn66view1

#### Example shock targets (operational guidance baseline)

There is no single universally mandated “algae shock ppm,” but WHO discusses “shock dosing” as raising free chlorine (often ≥10 mg/L for 1–4 hours for routine shock in some settings) and cautions that over/under dosing has consequences; for some problems, higher levels may be used while the pool is empty, returning to acceptable levels before reopening. citeturn38view2turn40view0turn39view1

For algae response, many EPA-registered algaecide labels pair algaecide addition with **superchlorination/shock** and then specify circulation and cleanup steps. citeturn43view0turn56view1

#### Worked examples (10,000 and 50,000 gallons)

Below are worked examples for **raising FC by 10 ppm** (a common “shock-step” increment; actual targets should be set based on conditions and codes).

Using dichlor/trichlor theoretical available chlorine values (55–92%) from EPA/industry-linked literature: citeturn66view1

**Raise FC by 10 ppm in a 10,000-gallon pool**
- 10% liquid chlorine: ~1.0 gal  
- 12.5% liquid chlorine: ~0.8 gal (≈102 fl oz)  
- 65% calcium hypochlorite (cal-hypo): ~1.3 lb  
- 55% dichlor: ~1.5 lb  
- 90–92% trichlor: ~0.9 lb (note: trichlor is strongly acidifying and adds CYA). citeturn66view1turn37view3turn38view1

**Raise FC by 10 ppm in a 50,000-gallon pool**
- Scale linearly by volume (×5):
  - 10% liquid chlorine: ~5.0 gal  
  - 12.5% liquid chlorine: ~4.0 gal  
  - 65% cal-hypo: ~6.4 lb  
  - 55% dichlor: ~7.6 lb  
  - 90–92% trichlor: ~4.6 lb. citeturn66view1turn37view3

**Operational cautions**
- WHO describes that chlorine-based disinfectants include hypochlorite salts and chlorinated isocyanurates and notes the strong pH dependence of HOCl vs OCl⁻; maintaining pH within defined limits supports disinfection. citeturn38view1turn40view0  
- WHO also notes cyanuric acid accumulates and requires dilution (water replacement) to control. citeturn37view3turn38view1

### Protocol by algae type

#### Green algae protocol

**Day zero (hours 0–6): “Kill phase start”**
- Test and balance: bring pH into range (commonly 7.2–7.8) and ensure disinfectant target can be maintained. citeturn40view0turn64view3turn38view1  
- Remove debris (leaves, organic load) to reduce chlorine demand. citeturn43view1turn64view2  
- Brush entire pool (walls, floor, steps), then vacuum to remove loosened biomass. citeturn43view0turn45view1turn38view0  
- Shock/superchlorinate to a chosen intervention level and keep circulation on; WHO notes shock dosing is used to control nuisance microorganisms and organics and emphasizes adequate mixing and 24h operation of dosing/circulation systems during control. citeturn38view2turn38view0

**Adjunct (optional): polyquat or non-foaming algaecide**
- A 60% polymeric quaternary (“polyquat 60”) label example specifies:
  - Freshly cleaned pool: 6–12 fl oz per 10,000 gal.
  - Visible algae: 12–18 fl oz per 10,000 gal.
  - Vacuum after 24h; maintenance 2–4 fl oz per 10,000 gal every 5–7 days. citeturn45view1turn45view0  
- Rationale: use when you need extra margin for clearance or when recurring problems suggest niches remain; still prioritize chlorine/filtration/hydraulics as primary controls. citeturn41view0turn38view0

**Day one (hours 24–36): “Clear phase”**
- Vacuum dead algae; backwash/clean filter based on pressure differential. citeturn45view1turn38view3  
- Continue brushing, maintain disinfectant.

**Exit criteria**
- Water clear enough to meet local visibility standards; disinfectant and pH back in the operating range. Wisconsin and MAHC-derived materials treat clarity/disinfectant adherence as critical. citeturn40view0turn39view0turn39view1

#### Mustard (yellow) algae protocol

Because mustard algae often behaves as a recurring, surface-associated growth, add **decontamination of accessories** and focus on shaded/low-flow niches.

**Day zero**
- Brush affected areas thoroughly. A sodium-bromide mustard-algae label example directs brushing before chemical steps. citeturn56view1  
- Apply sodium bromide product **per label**; example label dosing: **4 oz per 10,000 gallons** (double for severe). citeturn56view1  
- The same label directs **superchlorination** (example: 1 gallon liquid chlorinating compound or 1 lb dry per 10,000 gallons) and indicates swimming may resume a few hours after treatment (site-specific and code-dependent). citeturn56view1

**Important regulatory/safety note (outdoor pools)**
- Some EPA-registered sodium bromide products now include restrictions such as “not for use in outdoor pools” and warnings about bromate formation under sunlight, plus discharge instructions. Always follow the specific product’s EPA label, which is legally enforceable. citeturn58view0turn12search3turn12search11

**Day one–two**
- Maintain strong circulation and filtration; vacuum settled material; keep pH controlled to maintain disinfectant effectiveness. citeturn38view3turn38view0turn38view1

**Accessory and niche remediation**
- Mustard outbreaks frequently recur via protected niches and reintroduction; treat steps, ladders, toys, brushes, and cleaning tools as potential reservoirs (operational best practice consistent with biofilm reservoir logic and documented pool-contamination dynamics). citeturn25view0turn38view0turn64view1

#### Black algae protocol

Black algae requires **biofilm-first tactics**.

**Day zero**
- Aggressively brush each spot to break the biofilm surface layer.
- Spot treat where allowed (e.g., localized chlorination) while maintaining system-wide disinfectant residual and pH control. WHO emphasizes that particulates and biofilms compromise disinfection and that filtration/hydraulics are key; black algae research shows biofilm traits that support persistence. citeturn38view0turn25view0

**Adjunct: targeted algaecides (label-driven)**
- Copper-based products are commonly positioned for algae control; EPA labels provide dosing and environmental restrictions:
  - A copper triethanolamine complex pool algaecide label lists dosing ranges by pool size and indicates swimming may resume immediately after treatment; it also warns about plant injury above certain copper levels and cautions about backflush discharge contact. citeturn54view1turn62view1  
  - Copper sulfate pentahydrate label guidance for pools suggests **1–2 lb per 60,000 gallons** to reach **0.5–1 ppm dissolved copper**, with copper testing every 2 weeks, using the lower rate for maintenance, and avoiding copper buildup; it also warns against discharging treated effluent to natural waters. citeturn53view0
- Scientific evidence: an open-access pool black-algae study found conventional copper-based algicides and innovative silver-nanoparticle approaches inhibited biofilm establishment/growth in bioassays, consistent with field observations that metals can be effective against certain resistant biofilms. citeturn25view0turn53view0

**Escalation criteria**
- If spots persist after repeated disruption and sustained chemistry (often over multiple days), consider surface remediation (acid wash/refinish) as biofilms may be anchored in porous substrates or cracks. This is consistent with biofilm persistence mechanisms described in recent pool black-algae research and with filtration/disinfection limitations. citeturn25view0turn38view0

## Mechanical cleaning and filtration strategy

WHO frames filtration as essential for safety (clarity) and for disinfection effectiveness because particles can shield microorganisms; filtration is also critical for removing chlorine-resistant protozoa and general particulate loads. citeturn38view0turn38view2

### Brushing, vacuuming, and debris handling

- Brush all surfaces (more frequent during outbreaks) to disrupt boundary layers and biofilms and to suspend algae for removal. citeturn43view0turn45view1turn25view0  
- Vacuum settled debris after kill steps; polymeric algaecide labels often instruct vacuuming at ~24 hours to remove debris. citeturn45view1turn43view0  
- Skim continuously and empty baskets; organic debris increases disinfectant demand and nutrient availability. citeturn41view0turn64view2

### Filter types and outbreak tactics

WHO describes nominal particle performance and operational implications: citeturn38view3turn38view2  
- **Cartridge filters**: nominally down to ~7 µm; cleaned by removal/washing; compact footprint. citeturn38view3  
- **Sand filters (medium-rate)**: nominally ~7 µm with the addition of suitable coagulant; cleaned by reverse-flow backwash, often with air scouring; sand life commonly several years. citeturn38view3  
- **DE / precoat-type filtration**: can provide ~1–2 µm removal; typically strong for “polishing” and fine particulate removal. citeturn38view3

**Outbreak operating mode**
- Run circulation continuously; WHO explicitly notes dosing/circulation systems should operate 24h/day during relevant management periods. citeturn38view2turn38view0  
- Backwash/clean based on pressure differential, turbidity thresholds, and manufacturer recommendations; WHO describes backwashing triggers and methods. citeturn38view3

### Hydraulic and circulation checks (fast wins)

- Verify return-jet direction, skimmer function, and that treated water effectively reaches common dead zones (steps, corners, behind fixtures). WHO highlights that good circulation and hydraulics ensure the whole pool is adequately served with treated water. citeturn38view0turn41view0  
- Document and correct equipment issues immediately; CDC guidance emphasizes ensuring disinfection and recirculation systems and filters are operating during routine management. citeturn64view2

### Interpreting costs correctly

Retail prices fluctuate rapidly; treat the above as **order-of-magnitude planning**, not procurement guidance. From an operations standpoint, the bigger cost drivers are typically **labor time (brushing, vacuuming, filter cleaning)** and **downtime/closure**, especially for commercial pools. Evidence-based prevention (stable residual, bather hygiene controls, good hydraulics/filtration) is usually economically dominant. citeturn41view0turn64view2turn38view0

## Safety and environmental precautions

### Chemical handling safety (human health)

Pool chemical safety failures are a recognized injury source. CDC toolkit guidance emphasizes restricting chemical handling to trained staff, posting procedures, documenting use, and responding to spills per an emergency plan. citeturn65search0turn65search1turn64view2

Key PPE and handling rules (public-health messaging and surveillance findings):
- Do **not** mix chlorine products with acids; toxic gas can result. citeturn65search4turn65search11turn65search12turn65search17  
- Follow product labels each use; open one container at a time; ventilate; minimize dust/fumes/splashes. citeturn65search4turn65search11turn65search7  
- Many chemical injuries arise from mixing incompatible chemicals, improper PPE, spills/splashes, and poor training/supervision. citeturn65search14turn65search4

### Pesticide-label compliance (algaecides)

Algaecides are pesticides. EPA states pesticide labels are legally enforceable (“the label is the law”), and products must be used consistent with label directions. citeturn12search3turn12search11  
Operationally, this means:
- Dose strictly per label.
- Respect re-entry/wait intervals (e.g., ≥1 hour on some labels; or chlorine range requirements before re-entry on others). citeturn58view1turn43view0turn45view1  
- Observe storage/disposal restrictions (do not dump concentrates to drains; observe hazardous-waste guidance). citeturn45view1turn58view2

### Environmental protection and discharges

Backwash and pool draining can harm receiving waters via disinfectants, metals, salinity, and turbidity.
- A municipal guidance example prohibits discharging pool water/backwash and materials to storm drains and requires dechlorination and “no algae/algaecide/suspended solids” conditions before certain discharges. citeturn59view0turn59view0  
- Florida environmental BMP guidance notes chlorine can be toxic even at low levels and references a chlorine discharge limit ≤0.01 mg/L for surface waters, recommending standing ≥48 hours after last chlorine addition (or use neutralizers like sodium thiosulfate) and ensuring water clarity and pH limits before discharge; it warns copper/silver algaecides can interrupt algal/plant growth in surface waters and should be used with caution before discharge. citeturn62view0turn62view1  
- Copper sulfate pool label instructions warn against discharging treated effluent to natural waters. citeturn53view0

## Prevention, monitoring, and the operator checklist playbook

### Core prevention targets (chemistry and operations)

Use local code/health authority requirements. As a durable baseline:
- Maintain disinfectant residual and pH in recommended ranges and test at least twice daily (more during heavy use), per CDC and Wisconsin public-facility guidance. citeturn64view2turn40view1turn40view0  
- Control combined chlorine; CDC notes many health departments limit combined chlorine to ≤0.4 ppm and provides breakpoint (superchlorination) guidance. citeturn64view1turn40view0  
- Monitor stabilizer (CYA) and prevent excessive accumulation (WHO and peer-reviewed EPA-linked literature: keep CYA controlled; high CYA reduces effective disinfecting properties; dilution may be required). citeturn37view3turn38view1turn66view0  
- Keep hydraulics and filtration optimized; WHO stresses filtration/hydraulics and notes backwashing triggers and filter-type performance. citeturn38view3turn38view0  
- Reduce nutrient input: encourage pre-swim showers and bather hygiene; WHO and CDC describe that cleaner bather practices reduce contaminants and improve disinfection efficiency. citeturn37view1turn64view3  
- Phosphate control: WHO notes algal growth requires phosphate/nitrogen/potassium and that phosphate can be reduced via coagulation/filtration; treat phosphate removers as secondary to disinfectant/hydraulics. citeturn41view0turn38view0

### Early-warning indicators (what to watch before it turns green)

Operational indicators that often precede visible algae:
- **Rising chlorine demand** (dose required increases); may indicate organics/algae/biofilm load. citeturn38view2turn64view1turn66view2  
- **Combined chlorine creeping upward** and odor/irritation complaints (chloramines). citeturn64view1turn40view0  
- **Clarity trending down** and filter pressure rising faster than usual (particulate load). citeturn38view0turn38view3  
- **Localized “dusty” deposits** in low-circulation/shaded zones (mustard phenotype). citeturn41view0turn38view0  
- **Persistent dark spots** that resist normal brushing (black algae suspicion). citeturn25view0

### Operator checklist playbook (printable structure)

**Immediate response checklist (first hour)**
- Confirm readings: FC/TC/CC, pH, CYA (if used), temperature; document. citeturn64view1turn40view0turn37view3  
- Inspect circulation/filtration: pump running, skimmers, returns, filter pressure; correct obvious failures. citeturn38view3turn64view2  
- Remove debris; brush a test patch; determine likely algae type/severity. citeturn43view1turn25view0  
- Decide closure/limited use based on clarity and disinfectant limits. citeturn39view0turn40view0turn38view2

**Treatment checklist (day zero to day two)**
- Adjust pH to optimize disinfection within required limits. citeturn38view1turn40view0turn64view3  
- Shock/superchlorinate (set target; dose by volume; mix well; keep circulation 24/7). citeturn38view2turn38view0  
- Brush full pool, including behind ladders and around fittings; spot treat black suspect areas. citeturn25view0turn38view0  
- Add algaecide only if selected, and only per EPA label (dose, re-entry time, compatibility, disposal). citeturn12search3turn43view0turn45view1turn56view1turn58view0  
- Vacuum settled debris (often day one); backwash/clean filter as indicated. citeturn45view1turn38view3  
- Re-test and document at least morning/evening; more often for public pools/high bather loads. citeturn64view2turn40view1

**Recovery checklist (day two onward)**
- Confirm stable disinfectant residual in range; CC controlled; clarity meets code; resume standard schedule. citeturn64view1turn40view0turn39view0  
- Identify root cause: low residual episodes, CYA creep, dead zones, filter underperformance, bather load/hygiene, phosphate/nutrient issues. citeturn41view0turn66view0turn38view0  
- Implement prevention plan: tighten testing cadence, backwash plan, tool sanitation, and circulation tweaks. citeturn40view1turn38view3turn64view2

```

**How to use the timeline**: green algae should often show major improvement within 24–72 hours under sustained kill-and-clear, whereas black algae commonly requires a longer disruption-and-control period because it behaves as a resistant cyanobacterial biofilm. citeturn25view0turn38view2turn38view0
