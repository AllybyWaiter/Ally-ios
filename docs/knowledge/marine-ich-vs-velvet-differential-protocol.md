# Marine Ich vs Velvet Differential and Treatment Protocol

## Objective

Differentiate marine ich and marine velvet quickly enough to prevent avoidable mortality, then apply system-safe treatment and quarantine strategy.

## Core principle

When uncertain, manage fast-progressing cases as potential velvet until ruled out.

1. Triage for respiratory compromise first.
2. Use wet mounts early (skin/fin plus gill).
3. Separate fish treatment system from reef/invertebrate display constraints.
4. Sustain treatment long enough to cover protected lifecycle stages.

## Rapid comparison (practical)

- Marine ich: often slower, cyclic visible lesions, prolonged off-host timing variability
- Marine velvet: often faster progression, early severe respiratory stress, high short-window mortality risk
- Both: only specific exposed lifecycle windows are reliably drug-susceptible

## Diagnostic workflow

1. Clinical tempo and gill distress assessment.
2. Immediate wet mount microscopy for organism morphology.
3. If ambiguous, escalate to molecular testing where available.
4. Reassess differentials if microscopy is repeatedly nondiagnostic.

## Treatment tracks

### Marine ich track

- Maintain validated therapeutic exposure across full lifecycle window.
- Copper-based protocols and other validated options require measured concentration control and sustained duration.
- Do not end therapy based only on visible spot reduction.

### Marine velvet track

- Immediate parasite-load reduction plus sustained suppression of reinfection stages.
- Time-to-treatment is critical; delays are high risk.
- Continue treatment long enough to cover repeated dinospore emergence.

## System constraints and safety

- Reef/invertebrate displays are generally incompatible with therapeutic copper and many bath medications.
- Hospital/quarantine systems are usually required for fish treatment.
- Monitor oxygen, ammonia, nitrite, and treatment concentration stability throughout.

## Fallow and quarantine strategy

- Keep treatment and display workflows separate.
- Use fishless display intervals and robust disinfection/biosecurity practices based on lifecycle persistence risk.
- Quarantine incoming fish before display introduction; include symptom surveillance and, when possible, microscopy.

## Escalation triggers

- Rapid respiratory decline
- Ongoing mortality after treatment initiation
- Inability to maintain target therapeutic range
- Ambiguous diagnosis with worsening course

## Safety note

This protocol is a differential and response framework. Severe marine outbreaks require aquatic veterinary support and local legal/regulatory compliance for drug use.
