# Reef Alkalinity, Calcium, and Magnesium Balancing Protocol

## Objective

Maintain stable alk/Ca/Mg with repeatable control logic and conservative correction rates.

## Control concept

Treat alkalinity as the primary control variable:

- Alkalinity moves fastest and shows demand changes early.
- Calcium follows more slowly.
- Magnesium stabilizes the system and reduces precipitation risk.

## Practical target bands

- Alkalinity: 7 to 9 dKH (or chosen stable setpoint within broader reef-safe band)
- Calcium: 400 to 450 ppm
- Magnesium: 1250 to 1400 ppm

## Stoichiometric expectation

For calcification-dominant demand, a useful approximation is:

- About 1 dKH alkalinity corresponds to about 7 ppm calcium consumption.

If this relationship drifts heavily, check for test error, precipitation, salinity drift, or non-calcification alkalinity sinks.

## Correction sequence

1. Verify salinity and testing quality.
2. Correct magnesium first when low.
3. Correct alkalinity toward target.
4. Correct calcium toward target.
5. Switch to maintenance dosing and tune slowly.

## Conservative daily correction ceilings

- Alkalinity: no more than about 1.0 to 1.4 dKH/day
- Calcium: no more than about 20 to 50 ppm/day
- Magnesium: no more than about 50 to 100 ppm/day

Use the stricter bound if livestock is stressed or system is unstable.

## Maintenance tuning loop

1. Measure alkalinity drop over 24 to 120 hours.
2. Set daily dose to replace measured drop.
3. Adjust total daily dose in small increments.
4. Split doses through the day to reduce precipitation and pH spikes.

## Failure patterns

- Alk drops quickly, Ca looks unchanged: often normal test sensitivity plus real demand.
- Clouding after dosing: local precipitation from overdosing or poor spacing.
- Cannot hold alk/Ca: often low Mg, dosing collision, salinity error, or hidden precipitation sites.
