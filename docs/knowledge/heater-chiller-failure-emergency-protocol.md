# Heater and Chiller Failure Emergency Protocol

## Objective

Provide an emergency response framework for thermal-control failures affecting aquatic systems and facility water environments.

## Core principle

Treat heater/chiller failures as safety incidents first, equipment incidents second.

1. Protect people and animals from immediate hazard.
2. Stabilize environment and critical loads.
3. Isolate unsafe energy sources before invasive work.
4. Recover with verified root-cause correction.

## First-response triage

Immediate red flags:

- Electrical smell/smoke/arcing
- Refrigerant leak alarm or irritant vapor concern
- Fuel/combustion abnormality
- Flooding near energized equipment
- Rapid temperature drift threatening livestock or infrastructure

## First 0-15 minutes

1. Classify hazard and activate emergency communication pathway.
2. Evacuate/restrict area if hazardous atmosphere or electrical risk exists.
3. Execute remote shutdown/ventilation controls where applicable.
4. Protect critical thermal loads with backup strategy.

## Stabilization sequence

- Preserve oxygen and circulation support in aquatic systems.
- Prevent freeze/overheat secondary damage.
- Capture alarms, timestamps, and operating-state data.
- Prepare safe handoff to qualified technical responders.

## Technical-work gate

Before hands-on diagnostics:

- De-energize and lock out applicable sources.
- Relieve pressure where needed.
- Verify safe condition before opening equipment.

## Recovery criteria

- Hazard source controlled
- Root cause identified and corrected
- Safe restart checklist complete
- Trend monitoring confirms stability window

## Prevention essentials

- Redundant thermal and aeration capacity
- Alarm routing and drill readiness
- Spare critical components and temporary cooling/heating plan
- Regular inspection and trend-based maintenance

## Safety note

Do not bypass protective controls to force restart. If life-safety or chemical-release risk is present, treat as an emergency response event.
