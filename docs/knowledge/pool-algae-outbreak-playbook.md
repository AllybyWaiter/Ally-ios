# Pool Algae Outbreak Playbook (Green, Mustard, Black)

## Objective

Provide a staged response to algae outbreaks that combines chemistry correction, mechanical removal, and filtration recovery.

## Core principle

Algae control fails when chemistry is corrected but biofilm and debris are left in place.

1. Restore disinfectant effectiveness.
2. Brush and remove biomass aggressively.
3. Run filtration continuously through kill-and-clear.
4. Fix root-cause recurrence drivers.

## Outbreak type profiles

### Green algae

- Water-column haze or green film
- Usually responds fastest to sustained chlorine + brushing + vacuuming

### Mustard algae

- Dust-like yellow film in shade/low-flow zones
- Recurs easily without niche treatment and accessory decontamination

### Black algae

- Anchored dark spots in rough surfaces
- Biofilm-dominant behavior, requires repeated mechanical disruption

## Response sequence

1. Test FC, CC, pH, and CYA immediately.
2. Bring pH and sanitizer to effective treatment range.
3. Brush all affected surfaces (target dead zones).
4. Vacuum and remove debris.
5. Keep circulation/filtration continuous; clean/backwash by pressure rise.
6. Re-dose and retest on scheduled intervals until clear.

## Adjunct treatment posture

- Algaecides are adjuncts, not primary replacements for chlorine control.
- Copper and bromide products require strict label compliance and environmental caution.
- If repeated failures occur, inspect surfaces, hydraulics, and persistent reservoirs.

## Reopen criteria

- Clarity restored to safety standard
- Sanitizer and pH returned to operating window
- No ongoing rapid demand collapse

## Prevention stack

- Stable residual and pH control
- Dead-zone circulation improvements
- Routine brushing in low-flow zones
- Debris and nutrient load reduction
- Trend monitoring before visible bloom stages

## Safety note

Treat algaecides as pesticides: label directions are legally enforceable and discharge handling may be regulated.
