# Saltwater Pool (SCG) Balancing and Cell Care Workflow

## Objective

Provide a practical operations workflow for saltwater pools using a salt chlorine generator (SCG), including water balancing and cell-care lifecycle control.

## Core principle

An SCG is a chlorine production tool, not a chemistry autopilot.

1. Validate water chemistry manually.
2. Keep scaling/corrosion risk in control.
3. Inspect cell on schedule.
4. Clean gently and only when needed.

## Core control parameters

- FC and pH as daily primary controls
- TA, CH, and saturation index for scale prevention
- CYA for UV balance (outdoor systems)
- Salinity in manufacturer operating range
- Temperature awareness for low-temp output cutoffs

## Daily and weekly workflow

1. Daily: test FC and pH, confirm flow/salt/temp status on controller.
2. Adjust runtime/output based on measured FC trend, not guesswork.
3. Weekly: check TA and index drift; inspect for early scale signs.
4. Monthly: verify salinity independently and inspect cell condition.

## Cell inspection and cleaning SOP

1. Power down and depressurize before removal.
2. Visual inspect plates for scale/debris.
3. Hose-clean first.
4. Use diluted acid wash only if scale remains.
5. Limit soak duration and rinse thoroughly.
6. Avoid pressure washers, metal scraping, and over-cleaning.

## Replacement triggers

- Persistent low output after proper cleaning and chemistry control
- Repeating service codes indicating worn cell behavior
- Runtime approaching manufacturer life-hour expectation

## Common no-output causes

- No flow / hydraulic restriction
- Low temperature lockout
- Salinity out of range
- Scaled cell
- High demand exceeding configured output/runtime

## Safety note

Acid handling and pressurized equipment hazards are significant. Follow manufacturer lockout, PPE, and dilution instructions exactly.
