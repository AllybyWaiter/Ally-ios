# Chlorine Pool Balancing Workflow

## Objective

Deliver a repeatable balancing workflow for chlorine pools that prioritizes sanitation, safety, and operational stability.

## Core principle

Pool balancing is a control loop, not a one-time correction.

1. Sample correctly.
2. Test core parameters.
3. Apply threshold-based corrections.
4. Circulate and retest.
5. Log and trend.

## Primary control parameters

- Free chlorine (FC): maintain effective residual
- Combined chlorine (CC): action when elevated
- pH: maintain disinfection efficiency and comfort window
- Total alkalinity (TA): stabilize pH behavior
- Cyanuric acid (CYA): outdoor UV protection with over-stabilization guardrails
- Calcium hardness (CH): scale/corrosion risk control
- Temperature and clarity: operational safety checks

## Practical workflow

1. Confirm safety preconditions (clarity, no contamination event override).
2. Measure FC/CC and pH first.
3. Correct FC below minimum before secondary adjustments.
4. Correct pH into target band.
5. Address CC events with oxidation and ventilation strategy where needed.
6. Run weekly TA and monthly CYA/CH/index checks.
7. Retest after mixing and document actions.

## Common failure modes

- Chronic low FC from underdosing or demand spikes
- High CC from unresolved organic/nitrogen load
- High CYA reducing effective chlorine performance
- pH drift from TA imbalance
- Over-correction cycles due to poor testing discipline

## Dosing guardrails

- Use volume-based formulas and measured product strength.
- Avoid mixing incompatible chemicals.
- Add chemicals in safe order and with circulation running.

## Closure/escalation triggers

- Unsafe clarity
- Residual outside allowable bather window
- pH outside safety window
- Incident-response events requiring dedicated protocol

## Safety note

Chemical labels and local code controls are enforceable. Use this workflow as operations logic, then apply site-specific legal requirements.
