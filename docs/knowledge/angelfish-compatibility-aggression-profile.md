# Angelfish Compatibility and Aggression Profile

## Objective

Provide practical rules for stocking angelfish communities with lower aggression and predation risk.

## Core principle

Angelfish are conditional cichlid aggressors, not always-aggressive fish.

1. Plan for adult size and pairing behavior, not juvenile behavior.
2. Control visibility, crowding, and territory pressure.
3. Match tankmates by size, temperament, and warm-water compatibility.
4. Escalate fast when injury or persistent chasing starts.

## Baseline setup targets

- Prefer tall tanks with meaningful swim height and line-of-sight breaks.
- For mixed angelfish communities, plan around larger systems (commonly 55+ gallons).
- Use vertical hardscape/plants to create visual separation.
- Keep oxygenation and filtration stable; avoid sudden maintenance shocks.

## Highest-risk compatibility failures

- Prey-sized fish once angels mature
- Fin nippers and hyperactive harassment species
- Pairing/spawning territory expansion in under-sized tanks
- Tankmates with strong parameter mismatch (especially temperature and hardness strategy)

## Compatibility grading

### Lower-risk profile

- Mid-sized, non-nipping, calm schooling fish that cannot be swallowed
- Peaceful bottom fish that do not compete for angelfish midwater territory

### Conditional profile

- Fish with moderate activity or partial parameter overlap
- Species that may coexist as juveniles but become risky as angels mature

### Avoid profile

- Fin nippers
- Very small schooling fish likely to become prey
- Aggressive cichlid combinations without heavy space margin

## Aggression trigger checklist

- New pair bond/spawn site behavior
- Persistent chasing in one zone
- Mouth fighting, torn fins, feeding suppression in subordinates
- Post-maintenance hierarchy resets after large abrupt water changes

## Intervention sequence

1. Add visual barriers and break direct sight lines.
2. Increase territory structure and multi-zone feeding.
3. Reduce crowding or remove the aggressor/pair.
4. If pair spawning drives conflict, separate community or pair.

## Monitoring cadence

- During stability: daily behavior scan
- During conflict: at least 2-3 checks/day + feeding access observation
- After intervention: reassess for 72 hours before declaring resolved

## Safety note

Compatibility outcomes depend strongly on adult size and reproductive status. Keep a separation plan ready before conflict starts.
