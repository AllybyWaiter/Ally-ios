# Saltwater Parameter Targets and Corrective Actions

## Objective

Define practical targets and safe correction priorities for marine and reef systems.

## Priority order during incidents

1. Immediate life support: temperature, salinity, oxygen, ammonia.
2. Stability drivers: alkalinity, pH, gas exchange, equipment reliability.
3. Nutrient management: nitrate and phosphate balance.

## Core targets (reef-capable baseline)

- Temperature: 76 to 80 F (minimal daily swing)
- Salinity: about 35 ppt (roughly SG 1.026 at 25 C)
- pH: 7.8 to 8.3
- Alkalinity: 7 to 11 dKH (pick stable setpoint)
- Calcium: 400 to 450 ppm
- Magnesium: 1200 to 1400 ppm
- Ammonia: 0
- Nitrite: 0
- Nitrate: low but non-zero (system dependent)
- Phosphate: low but non-zero (system dependent)
- Dissolved oxygen: preferably above 5 mg/L

## Correction rules

- Verify the measurement before correcting aggressively.
- Correct salinity and temperature gradually.
- Do not chase pH with rapid chemicals; fix gas exchange and alkalinity first.
- Split dosing into smaller additions through the day.
- Re-test after each correction block.

## Emergency ammonia protocol (marine)

1. Stop feeding.
2. Increase aeration immediately.
3. Perform large matched water change.
4. Support biofilter function and inspect failure cause.
5. Use binder only as temporary bridge, not a permanent fix.

## Nutrient corrections

High nitrate/phosphate:

- Reduce input (feeding and detritus accumulation).
- Improve export (water changes, skimming, media/refugium strategy).
- Avoid over-correction that drives nutrients to zero.

Low nitrate/phosphate:

- Reduce stripping media and avoid starvation conditions.
- Raise nutrients in controlled increments while tracking coral response.

## Monitoring cadence

- Continuous or daily: temperature, salinity, pH (if probe)
- Daily to several times weekly while tuning: alkalinity
- Weekly: nitrate, phosphate, calcium
- Monthly or as needed: magnesium, trace diagnostics
