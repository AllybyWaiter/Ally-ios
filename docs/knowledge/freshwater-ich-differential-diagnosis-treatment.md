# Freshwater Ich Differential Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol

## Objective

Provide a temperature-aware, evidence-aligned workflow to confirm freshwater ich and treat it effectively while avoiding common misclassification errors.

## Core treatment truth

Ich control fails when treatment timing ignores lifecycle biology.

1. Most protected stages are not reliably affected by waterborne treatment.
2. Free-swimming infective stages are the main target.
3. Repeated, temperature-timed dosing is required.
4. Oxygen support and environmental cleanup are mandatory.

## Confirm before committing

Strong workflow:

1. Clinical suspicion from signs (spots, flashing, respiratory stress).
2. Wet mount confirmation from skin/fin and gill samples when possible.
3. Differential check for look-alikes before repeating antiparasitic cycles.

## Common look-alikes to rule out

- Velvet-like dusting presentations
- Columnaris-like plaques/erosions
- Water-mold cotton growth
- Monogenean flukes
- Costia/Ichthyobodo and heavy Trichodina burdens

## Treatment workflow

### Step 1: stabilize

- Increase aeration and surface agitation immediately.
- Reduce feeding and remove dead/decaying material.
- Correct ammonia/nitrite instability before aggressive chemical stacking.

### Step 2: choose primary therapy compatible with system constraints

- Select approach based on species tolerance, plants/invertebrates, and regulatory constraints.
- Avoid high-toxicity options in mixed invertebrate/planted displays when fish cannot be moved.
- Prefer a hospital system when display compatibility is poor.

### Step 3: repeat by temperature window

- Warmer systems generally require tighter intervals.
- Colder systems require longer total treatment windows.
- Continue through full lifecycle interception, not just until spots fade.

### Step 4: reduce reinfection pressure

- Remove debris where tomonts can persist.
- Maintain high oxygen during all chemical exposure windows.
- Recheck with microscopy if available.

## Medication guardrails

- Potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide are not universal first-line ich solutions in all freshwater contexts.
- Metronidazole is not a primary ich treatment.
- Antibiotics are for diagnosed secondary bacterial disease, not primary ich eradication.
- Food-fish legality and withdrawal rules must be verified locally before treatment decisions.

## Escalation triggers

- Increasing respiratory distress
- Rising mortality despite temperature-timed repeat treatments
- Persistent unclear microscopy/differential
- Multi-system spread risk

## Prevention checklist

- Quarantine all new arrivals
- Screen gills as well as skin when possible
- Keep oxygen and filtration stable
- Remove dead fish and debris quickly
- Avoid equipment cross-contamination between systems
