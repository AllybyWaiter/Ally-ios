# Spa Bromine and Chlorine Management Workflow

## Objective

Define a high-frequency operational workflow for spa sanitation using chlorine or bromine systems.

## Core principle

Spas destabilize faster than pools due to heat, aeration, and high bather load.

1. Maintain residual continuously.
2. Test more frequently during use.
3. Correct out-of-range conditions immediately.
4. Use incident protocols for contamination events.

## Primary operational targets

- Chlorine program: maintain spa-appropriate FC minimum while open
- Bromine program: maintain spa-appropriate total bromine range
- pH in safe operating band
- CC action threshold management
- TA and CH for corrosion/scale control
- Maximum temperature safety cap

## Testing cadence

- Before opening: sanitizer + pH
- During operation: frequent residual/pH checks based on feed mode and load
- Weekly/monthly: TA/CH/index and additional chemistry checks
- Increase cadence during heavy-use periods

## Operational workflow

1. Verify recirculation and feeder status.
2. Sample correctly and test sanitizer + pH.
3. Correct sanitizer shortfalls first.
4. Correct pH and then buffering/hardness as needed.
5. Trigger oxidation cycle when CC or demand trend indicates buildup.
6. Log every correction and retest.

## Bromine-specific notes

- Bromide reserve products are not disinfectants on their own.
- Active bromine residual must still be established and maintained.
- Use bromine-equivalent interpretation carefully in testing and dosing.

## Incident response triggers

- Residual below minimum or above open-bather maximum
- pH outside safety limits
- Equipment failure affecting circulation/feed
- Fecal/vomit or suspected Legionella events

## Safety note

Spa response must prioritize occupant safety and rapid closure decisions when chemistry enters imminent-hazard territory.
