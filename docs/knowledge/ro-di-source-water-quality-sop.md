# RO/DI and Source-Water Quality SOP

## Objective

Produce stable, low-contaminant source water for aquariums and mixing systems by controlling pretreatment, RO performance, and DI polish quality.

## Core principle

RO and DI solve different problems and must be monitored separately.

- RO removes most dissolved salts and many contaminants.
- DI polishes remaining ions.
- Feedwater quality determines reliability, membrane life, and resin life.

## Scope

Use this SOP for source-water preparation for freshwater, saltwater, and reef systems where consistency matters.

## Critical control points

- Oxidant control before RO (chlorine/chloramine breakthrough is membrane risk).
- Particulate control before RO (SDI/turbidity/fine filtration).
- Scaling risk control (hardness, alkalinity, silica, recovery rate).
- Stage-by-stage conductivity/TDS trend tracking.
- DI exhaustion tracking and timely cartridge replacement.

## Practical workflow

1. Check feedwater conditions (temperature, TDS/conductivity, oxidant, turbidity where available).
2. Confirm pretreatment is healthy (sediment/carbon status, pressure drop, flow).
3. Verify no oxidant breakthrough before RO membrane.
4. Run RO and record feed/permeate conductivity and pressure trend.
5. Send RO permeate to DI polishing stage.
6. Verify final product water meets your target conductivity/TDS window.
7. Log production volume, trends, and any abnormal drift.

## Suggested action triggers

- Rapid rise in RO permeate conductivity: inspect pretreatment, membrane condition, and operating pressure.
- Rising pressure drop across prefilters: service filters and inspect feed solids load.
- Fast DI exhaustion: check RO rejection performance and dissolved gas/source-water shifts.
- Repeated instability after maintenance: recalibrate meters and verify flow-path correctness.

## Common failure modes

- Carbon stage exhaustion leading to oxidant membrane damage.
- High recovery operation causing scale and gradual flux/rejection loss.
- Inadequate pretreatment causing fouling and pressure increase.
- Poor instrument calibration causing false pass/fail decisions.

## Maintenance baseline

- Replace sediment/carbon filters by pressure-drop trend and schedule.
- Sanitize system components on a documented interval.
- Calibrate conductivity/TDS instrumentation on schedule.
- Replace DI resin on measured breakthrough, not only calendar time.

## Safety note

Handle pretreatment chemicals and waste streams per label and local regulations. Treat oxidant control and pressure safety as non-negotiable controls.
