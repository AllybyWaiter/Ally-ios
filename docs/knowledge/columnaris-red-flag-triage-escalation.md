# Columnaris Red-Flag Triage and Escalation Protocol

## Objective

Identify high-acuity columnaris patterns early, classify urgency, and execute first-response actions that reduce mortality risk.

## Core principle

Columnaris emergencies are often gill and oxygen emergencies.

1. Stabilize oxygen and environment immediately.
2. Start rapid presumptive diagnostics.
3. Match response speed to outbreak tempo.
4. Escalate early when red flags appear.

## Highest-acuity red flags

Treat as emergency if any are present:

- Respiratory distress or gill-predominant disease
- Moribund fish or loss of righting
- Rapidly accelerating mortality over hours to 1-2 days
- Multi-system spread (shared water/equipment exposure)
- Severe oral lesions with feeding cessation

## Triage categories

### Emergency (0-6 hours)

- Respiratory compromise, peracute deaths, systemic collapse, or fast spread

### Urgent (same day)

- Compatible lesions plus anorexia or moderate mortality
- Clear stress trigger (crowding, handling trauma, heat spike, water instability)

### Routine (48-72 hours)

- Mild localized lesions, stable behavior, low/no mortality, stable water quality

## Immediate response sequence

1. Maximize aeration and circulation now.
2. Reduce crowding and stop nonessential handling.
3. Remove dead fish promptly.
4. Measure and stabilize temperature, ammonia, nitrite, and organic load.
5. Do fresh wet mounts (skin and gill) for rapid presumptive confirmation.

## First-line treatment structure

- External-dominant disease: use approved/validated external protocols for your system and species.
- Suspected systemic involvement with fish still feeding: consider veterinarian-directed medicated feed pathways.
- Do not rely on environmental correction alone once rapid progression is established.

## Escalation criteria

Escalate to specialist/veterinary support immediately when:

- Any emergency criterion persists after first response window
- Mortality continues to rise despite intervention
- Diagnosis remains uncertain or mixed infection is suspected
- Regulated antimicrobial decisions are needed

## Humane endpoint note

For fish with severe irreversible distress and minimal recovery likelihood, humane euthanasia and diagnostic sampling should be considered within veterinary and welfare guidance.

## Prevention priorities

- Reduce crowding and handling trauma
- Keep organic load controlled
- Stabilize temperature and dissolved oxygen
- Maintain strict equipment biosecurity
- Quarantine incoming stock

## Safety note

This protocol supports triage decisions and outbreak control workflow. Severe cases require direct aquatic veterinary oversight.
