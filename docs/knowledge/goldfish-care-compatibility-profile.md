# Goldfish Care and Compatibility Profile

## Objective

Provide an operations-ready care framework for goldfish systems focused on waste control, oxygenation, and realistic compatibility.

## Core principle

Goldfish success is a filtration and stability problem before it is a medication problem.

1. Design for high waste output.
2. Maintain zero ammonia and nitrite.
3. Keep oxygen high and flow appropriate for body type.
4. Avoid temperature-mismatch stocking.

## System design priorities

- Use larger-volume systems with filtration headroom.
- Plan around adult biomass, not juvenile size.
- Maintain strong mechanical removal of solids.
- Keep robust biological media and aeration.

## Water-quality guardrails

- Ammonia: 0
- Nitrite: 0
- Nitrate: low and trend-controlled through water changes
- pH/alkalinity/hardness: stable and moderate, surface-dependent
- Temperature: consistent, avoiding tropical-overheat mismatch

## Feeding strategy

- High-quality staple with portion discipline
- Frequent overfeeding is a major toxin driver
- Fancy varieties benefit from easily digestible sinking-focused approach

## Compatibility framework

### Better fits

- Similar temperature-tolerant, non-aggressive tankmates in large systems
- Same-style goldfish mixes with matched swim ability

### Conditional fits

- Species that can coexist only with strong filtration and low competition

### Avoid fits

- Warm tropical fish requiring sustained higher temperatures
- Species likely to be eaten or to harass fins
- Invertebrates likely to be predated

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

- Daily: respiration, posture, feeding, clarity
- Weekly: full water panel + substrate waste export
- Monthly: filtration and capacity reassessment as fish grow

## Safety note

Goldfish are often under-housed because they are labeled hardy. Chronic crowding and undersized filtration are the dominant long-term failure modes.
