# Temperature Stress Triage Protocol (Aquarium and Pond Livestock)

## Objective

Rapidly stabilize fish and invertebrates exposed to dangerous heat or cold conditions.

## Core principle

Temperature emergencies are oxygen and stability emergencies.

1. Stabilize environment and oxygen first.
2. Correct temperature gradually.
3. Avoid sudden swings.
4. Monitor behavior and water quality during recovery.

## Trigger conditions

Activate triage if you observe:

- Rapid breathing, surface gasping, lethargy, loss of balance, or sudden hide/collapse behavior.
- Confirmed heater/chiller failure.
- Rapid room/weather shift causing tank/pond temperature drift.
- Temperature outside species-safe range with visible distress.

## First 0 to 15 minutes

1. Verify temperature with a second thermometer.
2. Increase aeration and surface agitation immediately.
3. Stop feeding.
4. Check filtration flow and ensure no equipment outage.

## Heat stress protocol

### Immediate actions

1. Reduce heat input:
   - turn off failed/overheating heater
   - reduce or temporarily disable high-heat lighting if safe
2. Increase evaporative cooling and airflow across surface.
3. Use cool-water staging only in controlled increments.

### Guardrails

- Do not crash temperature quickly.
- Prefer gradual correction in small steps with continuous observation.
- Maintain strong oxygenation throughout.

## Cold stress protocol

### Immediate actions

1. Restore reliable heat source (primary plus backup if available).
2. Insulate system from ambient drafts/cold surfaces.
3. Raise temperature progressively, not abruptly.

### Guardrails

- Avoid sudden warm jumps.
- Keep circulation active to prevent local hot/cold pockets.

## Recovery monitoring window (0 to 24 hours)

1. Re-check temperature at short intervals until stable.
2. Watch respiration, posture, and swimming behavior.
3. Test ammonia/nitrite because stress events often trigger secondary water-quality crashes.
4. Resume feeding only after behavior normalizes.

## Escalation criteria

Escalate to urgent veterinary/aquatic specialist support if:

- distress persists after environment is stabilized
- repeated loss of balance or severe neurologic behavior appears
- mass morbidity/mortality begins

## Prevention checklist

- Dual-temperature verification (controller + independent thermometer).
- Heater/chiller redundancy on critical systems.
- High/low temperature alerts.
- Seasonal maintenance and failure drills.
- Extra aeration capacity for heat events.
