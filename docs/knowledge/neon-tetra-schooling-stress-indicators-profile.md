# Neon Tetra Schooling and Stress Indicators Profile

## Objective

Provide measurable schooling and stress indicators for neon tetra husbandry decisions.

## Core principle

Schooling behavior must be interpreted with context: acute stress can tighten groups, while chronic stress often fragments them.

1. Track group structure over time, not one snapshot.
2. Correlate behavior with water-quality and oxygen data.
3. Protect social buffering with adequate group size.
4. Escalate on persistent fragmentation plus physiologic distress signs.

## Social baseline

- Neon tetras are schooling fish and should be maintained in proper groups.
- Very small groups are associated with higher stress behaviors.
- Practical management generally favors larger groups over minimal group counts.

## High-signal stress indicators

- Persistent isolation from school
- Repeated panic darting and collision behavior
- Surface gasping or prolonged abnormal water-column position
- Sustained feeding suppression
- Persistent color dulling outside normal light-cycle shifts

## Environmental triggers to prioritize

- Dissolved oxygen deficits
- Ammonia/nitrite instability
- Rapid temperature or lighting shifts
- Overcrowding without cover and escape routes

## Monitoring template

- Daily behavior checks at fixed times
- Weekly trend log for schooling cohesion and feeding participation
- Routine water chemistry and oxygen checks with trigger thresholds

## Intervention sequence

1. Correct oxygen and nitrogen-cycle risk first.
2. Increase cover and reduce visual stress.
3. Improve group structure if understocked socially.
4. Quarantine and evaluate if disease signs coexist.

## Safety note

Behavior-only diagnosis is weak. Combine schooling metrics with water-quality and respiration data before treatment changes.
