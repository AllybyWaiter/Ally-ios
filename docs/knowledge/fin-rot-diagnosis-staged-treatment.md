# Fin Rot Diagnosis and Staged Treatment Protocol

## Objective

Provide a practical, stage-based protocol to identify fin rot syndrome early, separate common look-alikes, and escalate treatment safely.

## Core principle

Treat fin rot as a syndrome, not a single disease:

1. Correct environment and stressors first.
2. Confirm likely cause (mechanical, parasitic, bacterial, fungal/mold, or mixed).
3. Match treatment intensity to severity.
4. Escalate quickly if tissue loss or systemic decline continues.

## What can mimic fin rot

Before antibiotic use, check for these frequent mimics:

- Mechanical damage (nipping, abrasion, decor injury)
- Columnaris-like disease
- Marine tenacibaculosis-like lesions
- Water-mold overgrowth on damaged tissue
- External parasites causing epithelial injury

Use wet mounts when possible to avoid treating the wrong condition.

## Staging criteria (objective)

### Stage 1 (mild)

- Distal fraying only
- Usually up to about 25% fin margin affected
- No ulcers, no fin-base necrosis, normal behavior

### Stage 2 (moderate)

- Progression to roughly 25-50% fin loss on affected fins
- Early discoloration/inflammation at margins
- Still no deep ulceration or severe systemic signs

### Stage 3 (severe)

- Roughly 50-75% loss, exposed rays, rapid progression, or hemorrhagic margins
- Reduced feeding/activity may appear

### Stage 4 (complicated/invasive)

Any one of:

- More than 75% loss
- Fin-base necrosis or spread into body ulcers
- Respiratory compromise, marked lethargy, anorexia, or ongoing mortality

## Stage-matched treatment workflow

### Stage 1

1. Isolate if practical.
2. Correct water quality and oxygenation immediately.
3. Stop aggression and remove abrasion sources.
4. Reduce handling and feeding load.
5. Recheck edges daily for progression.

Avoid shotgun antibiotics at this stage.

### Stage 2

1. Keep all Stage 1 actions active.
2. Add targeted external therapy only when findings support infectious involvement.
3. Continue daily monitoring of fin edge progression and behavior.
4. If no response after a correctly applied external course, escalate diagnostic intensity.

### Stage 3 to 4

1. Treat as potential invasive bacterial disease.
2. Obtain culture/susceptibility support where available.
3. Prefer targeted, system-safe therapy over broad empiric stacking.
4. Intensify biosecurity and supportive care.
5. Monitor closely for mortality trend and secondary ammonia/nitrite rise.

## Monitoring cadence

- Active decline: at least daily clinical checks, frequent water checks
- During treatment transitions: reassess every 24-48 hours
- Recovery phase: track fin edge stabilization first, then regrowth over longer windows

## Escalation triggers

Escalate one level immediately if any occur:

- Progression by a full stage within 48-72 hours
- New fin-base hemorrhage, ulcers, or respiratory distress
- Multi-fish involvement or rising mortality
- No improvement after a correctly executed treatment cycle

## Prevention checklist

- Quarantine and observe new arrivals
- Maintain stable water quality and oxygenation
- Control crowding and aggression
- Remove detritus and organic waste routinely
- Minimize traumatic handling and net injury
