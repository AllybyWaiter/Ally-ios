# Quarantine and Hospital Tank Setup SOP

## Objective

Standardize quarantine and hospital workflows that reduce disease introduction, improve treatment control, and protect display systems.

## Core principle

Quarantine succeeds on separation discipline and water stability.

1. Keep cohorts closed.
2. Use dedicated equipment only.
3. Monitor high-risk water parameters frequently.
4. Treat in isolation to protect the main system.

## Definitions

- Quarantine tank: isolation for observation and entry screening of new arrivals
- Hospital tank: isolation for active treatment of ill or injured animals

## Setup standards

- Bare-bottom preferred for cleaning and observation
- Seeded biological filtration where possible
- Reliable heater/temperature verification
- Continuous aeration with outage backup
- Non-porous hiding structures for stress control

## Biosecurity SOP

1. One-way workflow (display -> quarantine -> hospital).
2. Dedicated nets, hoses, buckets, tools.
3. No media/tool crossover without validated disinfection.
4. Restart quarantine clock if new animals are added mid-cycle.

## Water management SOP

- Action on any measurable ammonia or nitrite
- Frequent testing during first days and during treatment
- Water changes scaled to load and treatment effects
- Match replacement water temperature and salinity carefully

## Treatment governance

- Use diagnosis-led treatment choices.
- Avoid indiscriminate multi-drug stacking.
- Account for biofilter disruption risk during medication courses.
- Maintain dosing calculations and logs with verification.

## Monitoring and records

Track daily:

- Behavior and feeding
- Respiration and visible lesions
- Core water chemistry
- Medication administration and response

## Emergency triggers

- Rapid mortality cluster
- Persistent oxygen distress
- Uncontrolled TAN/nitrite despite intervention
- Suspected reportable disease event

## Safety note

A quarantine tank without strict workflow separation is not true quarantine. Process discipline matters as much as equipment.
