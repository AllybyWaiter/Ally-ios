# New Tank Cycling SOP (Fishless and Fish-In Guardrails)

## Objective

Establish a stable biofilter that processes ammonia and nitrite predictably.

## Preferred method

Fishless cycling is preferred whenever possible.

## Shared setup requirements

- Reliable filtration with bio-media
- Strong aeration and circulation
- Heater/temperature control (as needed)
- Dechlorination for tap water
- Tests for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, and KH/alkalinity

## Fishless cycling SOP

1. Stabilize temperature and circulation.
2. Dose an ammonia source to about 2 ppm.
3. Test ammonia and nitrite every 1 to 2 days.
4. Re-dose ammonia only when levels are not excessive.
5. Maintain KH to prevent pH crash and stalled nitrification.
6. Completion challenge:
   - Dose to about 2 ppm ammonia.
   - Pass when ammonia and nitrite both return to zero within about 24 hours.
7. Perform a large water change before adding livestock.
8. Stock gradually.

## Fish-in cycling guardrails

Use only when fish must be housed immediately.

### Daily safety rules

- Feed lightly.
- Test ammonia and nitrite daily.
- Perform water changes aggressively when thresholds are exceeded.
- Keep aeration high.

### Conservative action thresholds

Ammonia (total):

- Caution: `>= 0.25 ppm`
- Action: `>= 0.50 ppm`
- Emergency: `>= 1.0 ppm`

Nitrite:

- Caution: `>= 0.10 ppm`
- Action: `>= 0.25 ppm`
- Emergency: `>= 0.50 ppm`

When thresholds are crossed:

1. Water change to target safe range.
2. Increase aeration.
3. Reduce feeding.
4. Consider temporary binder/chloride support where compatible.

## pH and KH during cycling

- Nitrification consumes alkalinity.
- Low KH causes pH instability and biofilter slowdown.
- Maintain KH support through buffered change water rather than large in-tank swings.

## Completion criteria

Cycling is complete when, after normal feeding load (fish-in) or challenge dose (fishless):

- Ammonia returns to zero quickly.
- Nitrite returns to zero quickly.
- Nitrate is present.
- Values stay stable across repeated checks.
