# Freshwater Parameter Targets and Corrective Actions

## Objective

Provide a practical freshwater aquarium target and response framework that emphasizes fish safety and stability.

## Core targets (general community baseline)

- pH: roughly 6.5 to 7.8 (species dependent)
- Ammonia: 0
- Nitrite: 0
- Nitrate: ideally under 20 ppm, commonly acceptable under 40 ppm for many communities
- Temperature: species-specific, stable daily profile
- KH: keep measurable and stable to prevent pH crash
- GH: species-specific, matched to livestock needs

## Incident triage order

1. Oxygen and circulation
2. Ammonia and nitrite
3. Temperature stability
4. pH/KH stability
5. Long-term nitrate control

## Corrective playbook by symptom

### Any ammonia or nitrite detection in established tank

- Treat as active failure.
- Execute emergency water change and aeration protocol.
- Reduce feeding and identify root cause.

### Chronic nitrate elevation

- Increase export (water change schedule, debris removal, plant uptake where relevant).
- Lower nutrient input (feeding, decay control).
- Validate source water contribution.

### Recurrent pH swings

- Check KH trend first.
- Improve gas exchange.
- Use buffered change water strategy instead of repeated in-tank pH chasing.

## Correction rate guardrails

- Favor multiple smaller adjustments over one large swing.
- Re-test after each correction block.
- Keep changes predictable and logged.

## Monitoring cadence

- During instability: daily ammonia, nitrite, pH, temperature
- Routine: weekly nitrate and KH; periodic GH
- After any stocking/filter/feeding change: increase monitoring for 1 to 2 weeks
