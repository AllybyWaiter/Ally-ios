# Betta Care and Compatibility Profile

## Objective

Define practical care standards and compatibility guardrails for Betta splendens systems.

## Core principle

Warm stable water and low social stress outperform aggressive medication-based correction.

1. Keep ammonia and nitrite at zero.
2. Hold stable warm temperature with low flow.
3. Use structured enrichment and cover.
4. Treat compatibility as individual-risk management.

## Baseline care targets

- Temperature: commonly around 24-28 C (76-82 F), kept stable
- pH and hardness: prioritize stability over perfect numbers
- Nitrogen: ammonia 0, nitrite 0, nitrate kept low
- Filtration: gentle but continuous
- Habitat: hides, plants, surface access, secure lid

## Tank sizing posture

- Small unstable volumes fail quickly on water quality.
- A practical solo baseline is around 5+ gallons, with larger preferred for community attempts.
- Community setups need significantly more space and visual separation.

## Feeding framework

- Protein-forward staple diet
- Portion control to avoid waste spikes
- Remove leftovers quickly
- Adjust frequency by age, activity, and water quality stability

## Compatibility rules

### Lower-risk candidates

- Peaceful non-nipping species with similar temperature needs
- Calm bottom dwellers in adequately sized planted systems

### Conditional candidates

- Small schooling fish that may be stressed by territorial behavior
- Invertebrates where predation risk is betta-dependent

### Avoid candidates

- Additional male bettas in shared space
- Fin nippers
- Long-finned lookalike fish that trigger aggression

## Quarantine and health guardrails

- Quarantine new arrivals before community introduction
- Escalate quickly for persistent fin damage, respiratory signs, or feeding shutdown
- Reserve broad medication stacking for diagnosed need

## Emergency triggers

- Measurable ammonia or nitrite
- Rapid respiration/surface distress
- Severe aggression injury
- Fast decline after recent additions

## Safety note

Bettas are highly individual in aggression profile. A fallback separation tank should always be available in community plans.
