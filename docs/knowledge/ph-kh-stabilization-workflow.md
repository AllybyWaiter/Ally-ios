# pH and KH Stabilization Workflow

## Objective

Stabilize pH by controlling alkalinity (KH), gas exchange, and correction pace.

## Key concept

pH stability is mainly a KH/alkalinity and CO2 management problem.

- KH buffers acid load.
- CO2 drives daily pH movement.
- Nitrification consumes alkalinity over time.

## Standard workflow

1. Measure baseline after water equilibrates with air:
   - pH
   - KH/alkalinity
   - GH
   - temperature
2. Identify water source mode:
   - tap
   - RO/DI
   - blended
3. Set a target KH range suitable for livestock.
4. Implement buffered change-water strategy.
5. Track trend, not single-point pH.

## KH adjustment formulas

Approximate grams required:

- `NaHCO3_g = 0.02975 * volume_L * delta_dKH`
- `Na2CO3_g = 0.01983 * volume_L * delta_dKH`

Where:

- `NaHCO3` gives a gentler pH push.
- `Na2CO3` gives a stronger pH push.

## Practical guardrails

- Avoid large single-shot pH adjustments.
- Increase aeration before using aggressive pH chemicals.
- Re-test after each staged correction.
- In low KH systems, monitor for day-night pH swing and nitrification-driven KH decline.

## Freshwater operating guidance

- Community fish systems usually benefit from measurable, stable KH.
- Planted systems may run lower KH but need tighter CO2 control and monitoring.

## Reef operating guidance

- Keep salinity stable first.
- Hold alkalinity stable and avoid pH chasing above safe alkalinity.
- Use distributed dosing to limit local high-pH events.

## Troubleshooting quick map

- pH drifting down over days: KH consumption likely; increase buffered replacement plan.
- pH swings day/night: review CO2 and aeration timing.
- pH low despite normal KH: check indoor CO2 and gas exchange.
- pH unstable after dosing: lower single-dose size and increase spacing.
